Emergency Rules 
MISSOURI REGISTER 

Rules appearing under this heading are filed under the authority granted by section 536.025, RSMo 2016. An emergency rule may be adopted by an agency if the agency finds that an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare, or a compelling governmental interest requires emergency action; follows procedures best calculated to assure fairness to all interested persons and parties under the circumstances; follows procedures which comply with the protections extended by the Missouri and the United States Constitutions; limits the scope of such rule to the circum- stances creating an emergency and requiring emergency procedure, and at the time of or prior to the adoption of such rule files with the secretary of state the text of the rule togeth- er with the specific facts, reasons, and findings which support its conclusion that there is an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare which can be met only through the adoption of such rule and its reasons for concluding that the procedure employed is fair to all interested persons and par- ties under the circumstances. 
Rules filed as emergency rules may be effective not less than ten (10) days after filing or at such later date as may be specified in the rule and may be terminated at any time by the state agency by filing an order with the secretary of state fixing the date of such termination, which order shall be published by the secretary of state in the Missouri Register as soon as practicable. 
All emergency rules must state the period during which they are in effect, and in no case can they be in effect more than one hundred eighty (180) calendar days or thirty (30) legislative days, whichever period is longer. Emergency rules are not renewable, although an agency may at any time adopt an identical rule under the normal rulemaking proce- dures. 
Title 20—DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND PROFESSIONAL REGISTRATION Division 2245—Real Estate Appraisers Chapter 1—Organization and Description of Commission 
EMERGENCY AMENDMENT 20 CSR 2245-1.010 General Organization. The board is amending 
section (9). 
PURPOSE: This amendment changes the version of the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) that real estate appraisers are required to adhere to pursuant to section 339.535, RSMo. 
EMERGENCY STATEMENT: This rule is being amended to reflect the current version of Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) that real estate appraisers are required to adhere to pursuant to section 339.535, RSMo. Section 536.031.3, RSMo, allows an agency to incorporate by reference regulations, standards, and guidelines of an agency of the United States or a nationally or state-recognized organization or association without publishing the material in full. The reference in the agency rules shall fully identify the incorporated material by publisher, address, and date. Being that the newest edition was effective January 1, 2018, Missouri licensees need to be held accountable to this edition when completing an appraisal assignment for properties located within the state. 
The Appraisal Subcommittee (ASC) of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) was created on August 9, 1989, pursuant to Title XI of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989. Title XI purpose is to “pro- vide that Federal financial and public policy interests in real estate transactions will be protected by requiring that real estate appraisals utilized in connection with federally related transactions (FRTs) are performed in writing, in accordance with uniform standards, by indi- viduals whose competency has been demonstrated and whose profes- sional conduct will be subject to effective supervision.” 
The ASC oversees the real estate appraisal process as it relates to federally related transactions in Title XI. The ASC is a subcommittee of the FFIEC. The FFIEC is an interagency body empowered to set uniform principles for the examination of federally regulated finan- cial institutions. 
Title XI sets out the ASC’s responsibilities including: 
• Monitor the requirements established by the states, territories, and the District of Columbia for the certification and licensing of appraisers qualified to perform appraisals in connection with FRTs. The ASC periodically reviews each state for compliance with the requirements of Title XI and the ASC is authorized to take action in the case of non-compliance; 
• Monitor the requirements established by the federal financial institutions regulatory agencies with respect to appraisal standards for FRTs under their jurisdiction as to which FRTs require the use of a state-certified appraiser or state licensed appraiser; 
• Maintain a National Registry of state-certified and state licensed appraisers who may perform appraisals in connection with FRTs; 
• Monitor and review the practices, procedures, activities, and organizational structure of the Appraisal Foundation (AF). 
Pursuant to section 339.535, RSMo “State – certified real estate appraisers, state licensed real estate appraisers, state licensed real estate appraiser trainees, and state-certified appraiser trainees shall comply with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice promulgated by the appraisal standards board of the appraisal founda- tion.” Representatives with the Appraisal Subcommittee were in Missouri auditing the program from June 25–27, 2018 at which time they noted and strongly recommended, more than once, that the com- mission amend the regulations to be compliant with their policies. While they did not say it would be an audit finding in their exit inter- view with staff, it very well could be, which would mean Missouri is non-compliant with federal regulations and would have to correct the violation promptly. Continued failure to be in compliance with federal regulations could have a very serious impact and preclude Missouri appraisers from working in the industry, as a state program must be in compliance with the federal requirements for continued participation. Therefore, the Missouri Real Estate Appraiser Commission’s regula- tions need to be amended to reflect the most recent edition effective January 1, 2018 so that Missouri appraisers are not in violation of fed- eral regulations. This emergency amendment is necessary because Missouri regulations must be consistent with federal regulations. Therefore, this emergency amendment is necessary to preserve a com- pelling governmental interest. 
The scope of the emergency amendment is limited to the circum- stances creating the emergency and complies with the protections extended in the Missouri and United States Constitutions. In devel- oping this emergency amendment, the board has determined the Missouri Real Estate Appraiser Commission’s regulations need to be amended to reflect the most recent edition effective January 1, 2018 so that Missouri appraisers are not in violation of federal regula- tions. The board believes this emergency amendment to be fair to all interested persons and parties under the circumstances. This emer- gency amendment was filed August 7, 2018, becomes effective August 17, 2018, and expires February 28, 2019.

Title 20—DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND PROFESSIONAL REGISTRATION Division 2245—Real Estate Appraisers Chapter 6—Educational Requirements 
EMERGENCY AMENDMENT 20 CSR 2245-6.040 Case Study Courses. The commission is amend- 
ing subsection (1)(B). 
PURPOSE: This amendment changes the version of the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) that real estate appraisers are required to adhere to pursuant to section 339.535, RSMo. 
EMERGENCY STATEMENT: This rule is being amended to reflect the current version of Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) that real estate appraisers are required to adhere to pursuant to section 339.535, RSMo. Section 536.031.3, RSMo, allows an agency to incorporate by reference regulations, standards, and guidelines of an agency of the United States or a nationally or state-recognized organization or association without publishing the material in full. The reference in the agency rules shall fully identify the incorporated material by publisher, address, and date. Being that the newest edition was effective January 1, 2018, Missouri licensees need to be held accountable to this edition when completing an appraisal assignment for properties located within the state. 
The Appraisal Subcommittee (ASC) of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) was created on August 9, 1989, pursuant to Title XI of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989. Title XI purpose is to “pro- vide that Federal financial and public policy interests in real estate transactions will be protected by requiring that real estate appraisals utilized in connection with federally related transactions (FRTs) are performed in writing, in accordance with uniform standards, by indi- viduals whose competency has been demonstrated and whose profes- sional conduct will be subject to effective supervision.” 
The ASC oversees the real estate appraisal process as it relates to federally related transactions in Title XI. The ASC is a subcommittee of the FFIEC. The FFIEC is an interagency body empowered to set uniform principles for the examination of federally regulated finan- cial institutions. 
Title XI sets out the ASC’s responsibilities including: • Monitor the requirements established by the states, territories, and the District of Columbia for the certification and licensing of appraisers qualified to perform appraisals in connection with FRTs. The ASC periodically reviews each state for compliance with the requirements of Title XI and the ASC is authorized to take action in 
the case of non-compliance; • Monitor the requirements established by the federal financial 
institutions regulatory agencies with respect to appraisal standards for FRTs under their jurisdiction as to which FRTs require the use of a state-certified appraiser or state licensed appraiser; 
• Maintain a National Registry of state-certified and state licensed appraisers who may perform appraisals in connection with FRTs; 
• Monitor and review the practices, procedures, activities, and organizational structure of the Appraisal Foundation (AF). 
Pursuant to section 339.535, RSMo “State – certified real estate appraisers, state licensed real estate appraisers, state licensed real estate appraiser trainees, and state-certified appraiser trainees shall comply with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice promulgated by the appraisal standards board of the appraisal foun- dation.” Representatives with the Appraisal Subcommittee were in Missouri auditing the program from June 25–27, 2018 at which time they noted and strongly recommended, more than once, that the com- mission amend the regulations to be compliant with their policies. While they did not say it would be an audit finding in their exit inter- view with staff, it very well could be, which would mean Missouri is non-compliant with federal regulations and would have to correct the violation promptly. Continued failure to be in compliance with federal regulations could have a very serious impact and preclude Missouri appraisers from working in the industry, as a state program must be in compliance with the federal requirements for continued participation. Therefore, the Missouri Real Estate Appraiser Commission’s regula- tions need to be amended to reflect the most recent edition effective January 1, 2018 so that Missouri appraisers are not in violation of fed- eral regulations. This emergency amendment is necessary because Missouri regulations must be consistent with federal regulations. Therefore, this emergency amendment is necessary to preserve a com- pelling governmental interest. 
The scope of the emergency amendment is limited to the circum- stances creating the emergency and complies with the protections extended in the Missouri and United States Constitutions. In devel- oping this emergency amendment, the board has determined the Missouri Real Estate Appraiser Commission’s regulations need to be amended to reflect the most recent edition effective January 1, 2018 so that Missouri appraisers are not in violation of federal regula- tions. The board believes this emergency amendment to be fair to all interested persons and parties under the circumstances. This emer- gency amendment was filed August 7, 2018, becomes effective August 17, 2018, and expires February 28, 2019. 
(1) General. (B) Case study courses shall be at least thirty (30) hours of instruc-

An applicant for licensure or certification may receive thirty (30) hours of pre-licensure education credit upon passage of an examination approved by the Appraiser Qualifications Board (AQB) course approval program or by an alternate method established by the AQB. A licensee may receive twenty-eight (28) hours of continuing education credit for a case study course as allowed pursuant to 20 CSR 2245-8.010.

Proposed Rules 
MISSOURI REGISTER 

Under this heading will appear the text of proposed rules and changes. The notice of proposed rulemaking is required to contain an explanation of any new rule or any change in an existing rule and the reasons therefor. This is set out in the Purpose section with each rule. Also required is a citation to the legal authority to make rules. This appears fol- lowing the text of the rule, after the word “Authority.” Entirely new rules are printed without any special symbol- 
ogy under the heading of proposed rule. If an existing rule is to be amended or rescinded, it will have a heading of proposed amendment or proposed rescission. Rules which are proposed to be amended will have new matter printed in boldface type and matter to be deleted placed in brackets. An important function of the Missouri Register is to solicit 
and encourage public participation in the rulemaking process. The law provides that for every proposed rule, amendment, or rescission there must be a notice that anyone may comment on the proposed action. This comment may take different forms. If an agency is required by statute to hold a public hearing 
before making any new rules, then a Notice of Public Hearing will appear following the text of the rule. Hearing dates must be at least thirty (30) days after publication of the notice in the Missouri Register. If no hearing is planned or required, the agency must give a Notice to Submit Comments. This allows anyone to file statements in support of or in opposition to the proposed action with the agency within a specified time, no less than thirty (30) days after pub- lication of the notice in the Missouri Register. 
An agency may hold a public hearing on a rule even though not required by law to hold one. If an agency allows comments to be received following the hearing date, the close of comments date will be used as the beginning day in the ninety- (90-) day-count necessary for the filing of the order of rulemaking. 
If an agency decides to hold a public hearing after planning not to, it must withdraw the earlier notice and file a new notice of proposed rulemaking and schedule a hearing for a date not less than thirty (30) days from the date of publication of the new notice. 
Proposed Amendment Text Reminder: Boldface text indicates new matter. [Bracketed text indicates matter being deleted.] 
Title 12—DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE Division 10—Director of Revenue Chapter 24—Driver License Bureau Rules 
PROPOSED RESCISSION 
12 CSR 10-24.470 Procedure for Obtaining a “J88” Notation on a Drivers License for Deafness or Hard of Hearing. This rule established the procedures for an individual to obtain a “J88” (Deaf or Hard of Hearing) notation on a drivers license as provided in sec- tion 302.174, RSMo. 
PURPOSE: This rule is being rescinded because it is unnecessary, overly burdensome, and because a self-certification process is ade- quate for purposes of implementing SB 814 (99th General Assembly 2018). SB 814 removes “J88” as the indicator and establishes a “DHH” indicator. 
AUTHORITY: section 302.174, RSMo Supp. 2001. Original rule filed Nov. 15, 2001, effective May 30, 2002. Rescinded: Filed Aug. 8, 2018. 
PUBLIC COST: This proposed rescission will not cost state agencies or political subdivisions more than five hundred dollars ($500) in the aggregate. 
PRIVATE COST: This proposed rescission will not cost private enti- ties more than five hundred dollars ($500) in the aggregate. 
NOTICE TO SUBMIT COMMENTS: Anyone may file a statement in support of or in opposition to this proposed rescission with Missouri Department of Revenue, General Counsel’s Office, PO Box 475, Jefferson City, MO 65105-0475. To be considered, comments must be received within thirty (30) days after publication of this notice in the Missouri Register. No public hearing is scheduled.

[(H)](G) “County incentives” means the total amount of money counties are entitled to receive [whether under the new formula, or the old formula or both] from the federal incentives received by the state as set forth in Section 458A of the Social Security Act. County [I]incentives are equal to six percent (6%) of their counties’ TANF collections plus six percent (6%) of their counties’ non-TANF collections (not to exceed the six percent (6%) of TANF collections). Level A and B counties will receive six percent (6%) of their counties’ TANF collections plus six percent (6%) of non-TANF collections (up to one hundred fifteen percent (115%) of their coun- ties’ TANF collections).

[which] that have not been reimbursed pursuant to 13 CSR [30- 3.010] 40-108.010, or [which] that have not been covered by incentives [paid under the new and old formula], the counties will share the incentives on a pro rata share based on the percent of the counties’ total IV-D collections. If at any time federal incentives received by the state are insufficient to pay county incentives, then the federal incentives shall be distributed to the counties pro rata based on collections in IV-D cases. If the total federal funds received by the state [under the new formula] exceed the amount necessary to pay all counties allowable costs after reimbursement pursuant to 13 CSR [30-3.010] 40-108.010, and receipt of all incentives to which they are entitled [to under both the old and new formu- las], the state shall retain these incentives for use as appropriate[d]. 
[(4)](3) [Base Year Expenses.] The division will initially use a county’s first calendar year [1999] under a cooperative agree- ment with the Department of Social Services for child support services as the starting base year to determine the amount of allow- able expenses for each county. The base year will include expenses of the counties that are normal and usual yearly expenses for the counties’ operations. The division will exclude from the base year any one- (1-) time expenses not related to normal and usual expenses. After the first base year is established, then each year thereafter[,] the previously approved year’s expenses will be used as the base year. If a county does not utilize all of its base year allotment for expenses, the next year’s base year expense amount may be decreased by the amount not utilized by the county in the previ- ous year. The counties may request additional funding over the base amount from the director [of the division] in writing. These requests must be received by the director on or before the first day of July. Additional requests may be submitted as needed throughout the year. Requests may be made for increases to the base year or for a one- (1-) time expense. The director may approve the request, deny the request, or approve for reimbursement pursuant to 13 CSR [30- 3.010] 40-108.010. The director has sole discretion to approve, deny, or modify any requests for funds under this regulation. The director may not approve any requests for funds if funding is unavailable. Availability of funds will be determined by the direc- tor. 
[(5)](4) [Expenditures of Incentives. Incentives received by counties under the old formula may be used by the counties at their discretion.] Incentives received by counties [under the new formula] must be reinvested into the IV-D program. 
[(6)](5) Performance Audits. Counties must pass performance audits conducted by the division pursuant to 13 CSR [30-2.010] 40- 108.010 or submit corrective action plans approved by the director to receive full [incentives] allotment. Counties that fail to [achieve] successfully comply with approved corrective action plans shall be subject to reductions of their [incentives] allotment. These reductions will be at four percent (4%) of the previous base year’s expenses for the first failure, eight percent (8%) for the second consecutive failure, and sixteen percent (16%) for the third consec- utive failure and subsequent failures; these reductions will begin upon failure to achieve corrective action plans.

Title 13—DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES Division 40—Family Support Division Chapter 2—Income Maintenance 
PROPOSED AMENDMENT 13 CSR 40-2.050 Definition of Earned Income. The division is 
amending subsections (1)(A) and (C). 
PURPOSE: This amendment updates the names of programs admin- istered by the division. 
(1) In applying the earned income exemptions, as stated in section 209.240, RSMo, to an applicant for, or a recipient of, Supplemental Aid to the Blind and as stated in section 208.010, RSMo for an appli- cant for or recipient of [Old Age Assistance] MO HealthNet for the Aged, Blind, and Disabled (MHABD) or an applicant or recip- ient of [Aid to Dependent Children] Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), the following definition of earned income will be used: 
(A) The term earned income encompasses income in cash or in kind earned by a needy individual through the receipt of wages, salary, commissions, or profit from activities in which s/he is engaged as a self-employed individual or an employee. The earned income may be derived from his/her own employment, such as busi- ness enterprise or farming, or derived from wages or salary received as an employee. It includes earnings over a period of time for which settlement is made at one (1) given time, as in the instance of sale of farm crops, livestock, or poultry. In considering income from farm operation, the option available for reporting under [Old Age Supplemental] Social Security Disability Income, namely the cash receipts and disbursements method, that is, a record of actual gross, of expenses and of net, is an individual determination and is acceptable also for public assistance. With reference to commissions, wages, or salary, the term earned income means the total amount, irrespective of personal expenses, such as income tax deductions, lunches, and transportation to and from work. With respect to self- employment, the term earned income means the total profit from business enterprise, farming, and the like, resulting from a compar- ison of the gross income received with the business expenses, that is, total cost of the production of the income. Personal expenses, such as income tax payments, lunches, and transportation to and from work, are not classified as business expenses; 
(C) With regard to the degree of activity, earned income is income produced as a result of the performance of services by a recipient; in other words, income which the individual earns by his/her own efforts, including managerial responsibilities, would be properly classified as earned income, such as management of capital invest- ment in real estate. Conversely, for example, in the instance of capital investment where the individual carries no specific responsibility, such as where rental properties are in the hands of rental agencies and the check is forwarded to the recipient, the income would not be classified as earned income. In households where a[n] Supplemental Aid to Blind or [Old Age Assistance] MHABD claimant is entitled to an income exemption and where other persons are receiving other types of assistance, the exempted income also shall be disregarded in determining the need of the other persons for public assistance. 
AUTHORITY: sections [207.020,] 207.022 and 660.017, RSMo [1986] 2016. Original rule filed Sept. 26, 1951, effective Oct. 6, 1951. For intervening history, please consult the Code of State Regulations. Amended: Filed Aug. 8, 2018.

Pursuant to Article IV, Section 37 of the Missouri Constitution, the director of the Department of Social Services is charged with promoting improved health and other social services to the citizens of the state as provided by law. Section 660.010.2, RSMo, authorizes the DSS director to coordinate the state’s programs devoted to those who are unable to provide for themselves and for victims of social disadvan- tage. Section 660.012.2, RSMo, also entrusts the DSS director with the duty to use the resources allocated to the department to provide comprehensive programs and leadership in order to improve services and economical operations. To that end, the DSS director has deter- mined that the [transfer of the] State Technical Assistance Team (STAT) [from the Division of Family Services (DFS) to the Division of Legal Services (DLS)] under the Office of the Director (OD) improves the efficiency and economical operations of resources and maximizes services to the citizens of this state.

In performing its CFRP mis- sion, STAT is responsible for providing training, expertise, and assis- tance to county CFRP panels for the review of child fatalities includ- ing establishing procedures for the [preparation and submission of] collection and data entry into the national child death review Internet-based case reporting system, and preparation and sub- mission of a Final Report by CFRP panels as reflected in subsection (4)(K) of this rule.

[(L)](K) “Occupancy rate[.]” is [A]a facility’s total actual patient days divided by the total bed days for the same period as determined from the desk audited and/or field audited cost report. 
[(M)](L) “Patient day[.]” is [T]the period of service rendered to a patient between the census-taking hour on two (2) consecutive days. Census shall be taken in all facilities at midnight each day and a cen- sus log maintained in each facility for documentation purposes. Patient day includes the allowable temporary leave-of-absence days per 13 CSR 70-10.015(5)(D) and hospital leave days per 13 CSR 70- 10.070. The day of discharge is not a patient day for reimbursement purposes unless it is also the day of admission. 
[(N)](M) “Provider or facility[.]” is [A]a nursing facility with a valid Medicaid participation agreement with the Department of Social Services for the purpose of providing nursing facility services to Title XIX-eligible recipients. 
[(4)](2) General Principles. (A) Provisions of this reimbursement plan shall apply only to nurs- 
ing facilities with valid provider agreements certified by the 
[Division of Aging or the Department of Health] Department of Social Services, Missouri Medicaid Audit and Compliance (MMAC) for participation in the Missouri Medical Assistance (Medicaid) Program. 
(C) Program Approval—The [Division of Aging] Department of Health and Senior Services will approve or disapprove nurse assis- tant training programs in the state of Missouri. If the [Division of Aging] Department of Health and Senior Services withdraws approval of a formerly approved nurse assistant training program, the facility may continue to teach (and bill [DMS] MO HealthNet for) those nurse assistants who had already begun the training program. However, that facility may not begin training (or bill the division) for any additional nurse assistants until it again receives approval from the [Division of Aging] Department of Health and Senior Services. Nursing facilities receiving a “level A” violation or extend- ed or partially extended survey will be ineligible for reimbursement for a period of two (2) years after the date of exit interview by the [Division of Aging] Department of Health and Senior Services. 
(D) Training Agencies—Any nurse assistant training agency must be approved by the [Division of Aging] Department of Health and Senior Services per [13 CSR 15-13.010(7)] 19 CSR 30- 84.010(7). This training agency must provide seventy-five (75) class- room hours of instruction and one hundred (100) hours on-the-job training. The seventy-five (75) classroom hours of instruction may include lecture, discussion, video/film usage, demonstration, and return demonstration by an approved registered nurse (RN) instructor who remains with and is always available to students to answer ques- tions and to conduct the class. The one hundred (100) hours on-the- job training shall be done by an approved RN or licensed practical nurse (LPN) who meets [13 CSR 15-13.010] 19 CSR 30-84.010 clinical supervisor qualifications and who directly observes their skills when checking their competencies. The one hundred (100) hours on-the-job training shall be devoted to the student; and the clin- ical supervisor or instructor must not have other job duties at the same time, such as but not limited to, charge nurse duties, medica- tion pass duties and/or treatment duties. The facility will not be reim- bursed in the per-diem rate for the salary/fringes of the RN and/or LPN for time spent teaching the nurse assistant training program. 
(E) Medicaid Cost Reports—Costs for nurse assistant training and competency evaluations are to be reported in the [unallowable] non- allowable column on the Medicaid cost report and are not to be cov- ered in the per-diem rate. These costs include: any charge for train- ing by an outside training agency, the cost of the competency evalu- ation, teacher salaries and fringes, necessary textbooks, and other required course materials. However, costs for salaries of nurse assis- tants in training or replacement nurse assistants for those in training or testing are to be reported in the allowable column on the Medicaid cost report and are to be covered in the per-diem rate. 
(F) Billing—[Long-term care] Nursing facilities with valid provider agreements may bill the [Division of Medical Services] MO HealthNet Division for costs incurred for nurse assistant train- ing and competency evaluations for nurse assistants beginning the training after February 26, 1993. Facilities may only bill for nurse

Proposed Rules 
September 17, 2018 Vol. 43, No. 18 
assistants trained by an approved training agency and tested by an approved state examiner. This state examiner must be approved per [13 CSR 15-13.010(9)] 19 CSR 30-84.010(9) and must have a signed agreement with the [Division of Aging] Department of Health and Senior Services. Facilities may bill once a month on an approved nurse assistant training billing form. 
(G) Medicaid[—] Utilization—Reimbursement will be allocated based on the ratio of Medicaid days to total patient days as reported on the latest Medicaid cost report filed by the facility with a year ending in the most recent year that all nursing facility Medicaid cost reports have been desk audited. If the facility did not have a Medicaid cost report ending in the most recent year that all nursing facility Medicaid cost reports have been desk audited, then the aver- age ratio of Medicaid days to total patient days for all cost reports with ending dates in the most recent year that all nursing facility Medicaid cost reports have been desk audited will be used in calcu- lating reimbursement. 
[(5)](3) Reimbursement for Nurse Assistants Employed at the Time of Training. If a nurse assistant is employed at a nursing facility and then passes an approved nurse assistant training and competency evaluation program, the division will reimburse a facility if all the following criteria are met: 
(A) The nurse assistant is on the Missouri [Division of Aging] Department of Health and Senior Services nurse assistant register; (B) The individual is employed by the billing nursing facility at the 
time of passing the competency evaluation (final exam); (C) The following reimbursement amounts will be prorated based 
on Medicaid utilization: 1. Three hundred sixty-five dollars ($365) for a nurse assistant 
completing the entire basic course (all lesson plans, seventy-five (75) hours classroom training, and one hundred (100) hours on-the-job training) and passing the final exam; 
2. A percentage of the three hundred sixty-five dollars ($365) for nurse assistants who only complete a portion of the lesson plans and pass the final exam will be paid. The percentage will be based on how many lesson plans were completed. For example: 
If no on-the-job training was provided, and if only lesson plans 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 41, 42, and 43 were completed, the percentage of the $365 allowable would be: 
$ 34.50 classroom training ((18.36/hr × 75 hrs)/10) = $138 
$138 × 18.75 hours/75 hrs = $34.50 $ 0.00 on-the-job training (0 of 100 hours) $ 30.00 textbook and supplies $ 50.00 testing fee $ 25.00 certification fee $139.50 allowable to be prorated on Medicaid utilization 
3. Seventy-five dollars ($75) for nurse assistants who do not complete any lesson plans through a challenge and pass the final exam; 
(D) The facility which employs the nurse assistant must submit the bill for reimbursement to the division on the approved billing form; and 
(E) The facility must bill for nurse assistant training and/or com- petency exam within one (1) year after the nurse assistant passed the final exam. Nurse assistant training that was completed prior to one (1) year before the effective date of this regulation and began after February 26, 1993, will be allowed. 
[(6)](4) Reimbursement for Nurse Assistants Not Yet Employed at the Time of Training. If a nurse assistant is not employed at a nursing facility and that individual pays for the nurse assistant training and competency evaluation program, the division will reimburse a facility if all the following criteria are met: 
(A) The nurse assistant is on the Missouri [Division of Aging] 
Department of Health and Senior Services nurse assistant register; (B) The individual is employed by the billing nursing facility not 
later than twelve (12) months after passing the final exam; (C) The individual incurred costs for the training and testing, and the billing nursing facility submits to the division documentary evi- dence of those costs. The division will not reimburse costs if the nurse assistant received funding for the training through a grant or other funding source that is not required to be repaid by the nurse 
assistant; (D) The billing nursing facility must submit documentation that it 
has paid the nurse assistant for the cost it is submitting to the divi- sion; 
(E) The facility which employs the nurse assistant must submit the bill for reimbursement to the division on the approved billing form; (F) The division will prorate costs based on Medicaid utilization 
as follows: 1. Three hundred sixty-five dollars ($365) for a nurse assistant 
completing the entire basic course (all lesson plans, seventy-five (75) hours classroom training, and one hundred (100) hours on-the-job training) and passing the final exam; 
2. A percentage of the three hundred sixty-five dollars ($365) for nurse assistants who only complete a portion of the lesson plans and pass the final exam. The percentage will be based on how many lesson plans were completed. See paragraph [(5)](3)(C)2. of this regulation; and 
3. Seventy-five dollars ($75) for nurse assistants who do not complete any lesson plans through a challenge process and pass the final exam; and 
(G) The [Division of Medical Services] MO HealthNet Division will subtract one-twelfth (1/12) of allowable reimbursement for each month that the nurse assistant is not employed after passing the final exam.

Title 4—DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Division 265—Division of Motor Carrier and Railroad Safety Chapter 8—Railroads and Street Railroads 
ORDER OF RULEMAKING 
By the authority vested in the Missouri Highways and Transportation Commission under section 622.027, RSMo 2016, the commission rescinds a rule as follows: 
4 CSR 265-8.050 Facilities for Employees is rescinded. 
A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the proposed rescission was published in the Missouri Register on April 16, 2018 (43 MoReg 749). No changes have been made in the proposed rescission, so it is not reprinted here. This proposed rescission becomes effective thirty (30) days after publication in the Code of State Regulations. 
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The commission received two (2) comments on the proposed rescission. 
COMMENT #1: Jason Hayden, State Legislative Director for the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers (SMART), opposes rescission of this rule claiming there have been issues getting the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) onto railroad company properties to assist with OSHA complaints. SMART says rule rescission would greatly inhibit SMART’s ability to ensure continued upkeep of safe and san- itary railroad facilities for railroad employees. Instead of rescission, SMART recommends amending the rule to incorporate the OSHA regulations in Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 1910, 1926, and 1928. 
RESPONSE: The department believes the mandates in this rule pri- marily involve matters best handled in the private workplace between railroads and railroad employees and are already substantially included in the current OSHA regulations (29 CFR Parts 1910, 1926 and 1928). Portions of the rule are also already included in current FRA regula- tions, (Title 49 CFR, Part 229). No changes were made as a result of this comment. 
COMMENT #2: Brian Kelley, Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) Missouri State Legislative Board Chairman, opposes rescission of this rule. BLET believes the department’s reliance on federal OSHA regulations, as opposed to retaining the rule, is contrary to state legislators who oppose federal regulators interfer- ing in state level matters. BLET asks the commission and department to respect this rule, which has been vetted and revised over many

Orders of Rulemaking 

decades. BLET notes the rule applies only to railroad employees and has little, if any, impact on the general public. BLET volunteers to update the rule to make logical/rationale changes, but does not provide specific changes BLET would recommend making. 
RESPONSE: The department believes the mandates in this rule pri- marily involve matters best handled in the private workplace between railroads and railroad employees and are already substantially included in the current OSHA regulations (29 CFR Parts 1910, 1926 and 1928).

SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The commission received nineteen (19) comments on the proposed amendment. 
COMMENT #1: Smart Start, Inc. (SSI) requested modification to the definition “Alcohol retest setpoint” by replacing the word “rolling” with “running” to make the definition consistent with the amended definition of “Running retest” in the rule. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The department agrees and will make the change. 
COMMENT #2: SSI requested modification to the definition “Alcohol setpoint” by replacing the word “starting” with “operating” to make the definition consistent with the amended definition of “Breath alcohol ignition interlock device (BAIID)” in the rule. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The department agrees and will make the change. 
COMMENT #3: SSI requested modification to the definition “Circumvention” by replacing the amended definition for this term with the following: “To bypass the correct operation of a BAIID by starting the vehicle, by any means, without first providing a breath test.” SSI opined that the revised definition is consistent with the def- inition of “Circumvention” as published by the Association of Ignition Interlock Program Administrators (AIIPA). 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The department agrees and will make the change. 
COMMENT #4: SSI requested modification to the definition “Installation” by replacing the word “installers” with “technicians” to make the definition consistent with the proposed definition of 
“Technician” in the rule. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The department agrees and will make the change. 
COMMENT #5: SSI requested modification to the definition “Tampering” by adding the phrase “and/or blocking, moving, or dis- abling the camera, if required” as that language was originally part of the department’s amended definition of “Circumvention” that was removed by SSI’s public comment on “Circumvention.” RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The department agrees and will make the change. 
COMMENT #6: Consumer Safety Technology, LLC (CST) request- ed modification to the definition “Alcohol retest setpoint” by deleting this definition and modifying the definition of “Alcohol setpoint.” CST did not give a rationale for the change. 
RESPONSE: The department disagrees and the suggested changes will not be made. 
COMMENT #7: CST requested modification to the definition “Alcohol setpoint” by deleting the phrase “ignition interlock” and adding the phrase “or records a failed retest.” CST did not give a rationale for this change. 
RESPONSE: The department disagrees and the suggested changes will not be made. 
COMMENT #8: CST requested modification to the definition “Calibration” by adding the phrase “of testing and adjusting a device” to the existing definition. CST did not give a rationale for the change. 
RESPONSE: The department disagrees and the suggested changes will not be made. 
COMMENT #9: CST requested modification to the definition “Circumvention” by deleting the phrase “unauthorized, intentional, or overt act or” from the amended definition. CST did not give a rationale for the change. 
RESPONSE: Since the department has agreed with SSI to adopt the AIIPA’s definition for this term, the department will not make CST’s change. 
COMMENT #10: CST requested modification to the definition “Division” by capitalizing the word “department” in the definition and throughout the rules because it is a defined term in this rule. RESPONSE: The department disagrees and will not make this change because the secretary of state has previously requested this type of term to be lowercase. 
COMMENT #11: CST requested modification to the definition “Manufacturer” by replacing the definition with “An entity who is certified by the department to offer devices for installation in motor vehicles in this state.” CST did not give a rationale for the change. RESPONSE: The department disagrees and will not make the sug- gested change because the proposed definition of “Manufacturer” in the amended rule is the AIIPA’s published definition. 
COMMENT #12: CST requested modification to the definition “Mobile Service,” by adding the phrases “operation of an”; “sepa- rately and simultaneously with its parent fixed location service cen- ters” and; “Mobile service center shall comply with all of the requirements provided for the authorized service provider herein” to acknowledge the connection between a mobile service and the autho- rized service provider. CST also suggests deleting the phrase “igni- tion interlock.” 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The department disagrees with the deletion of the phrase “ignition interlock” and the suggested change will not be made since CST did not provide a ratio- nale for the deletion. But the department agrees with all of the other 

Page 2670 
September 17, 2018 Vol. 43, No. 18 

Orders of Rulemaking 

changes and will make those changes. 
COMMENT #13: CST requested modification to the definition “Override lockout” by adding “pure” into the definition. CST did not give a rationale for the change. RESPONSE: The department disagrees and will not make the sug- gested change because the proposed definition of “Override lockout” is the AIIPA’s published definition. 
COMMENT #14: CST requested modification to the definition “Photo ID technology” by replacing the term, “Photo ID technolo- gy,” with “Camera,” as the term “Photo ID technology” is not used in any of the proposed rule provisions. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The department agrees and will make the change and will renumber the remaining definitions accordingly. 
COMMENT #15: CST requested modification to the definition “Real-Time Reporting” by replacing “driver’s” with “operator’s,” because “driver” is an undefined term in this section and “operator” has an existing definition. CST also suggested inserting the phrase “without delay, as cellular reception permits” in this definition to reflect that real-time reporting can be delayed by cellular reception. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The department agrees and will make the change to replace the word “driver’s” with “operator’s.” But the department disagrees and will not make the suggested change to insert the phrase “without delay as cellular reception permits” because the potential for delayed real-time report- ing due to a cellular signal issue is covered by a separate commission rule, 7 CSR 60-2.030(1)(I)4. 
COMMENT #16: CST requested modification to the definition “Temporary lockout” by inserting the phrase “within ten (10) minutes” to correspond with 7 CSR 60-2.030(1)(C)3. when referring to the time frame within which three (3) failed attempts to provide a breath sample are recorded. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The department agrees and will make the change. 
COMMENT #17: CST requested modification to the definition “Violations reset” in subparagraph (1)(A)40.B. of this definition by inserting the phrase “running retest” and deleting the phrase “to pro- vide a retest sample” to make the subparagraph consistent with 7 CSR 60-2.030(1)(D)5. CST also requests a new subparagraph E., which states: “When a device is not serviced on its service date” to make the subparagraph consistent with 7 CSR 60-2.030(1)(E)2. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The department agrees and will make the changes. 
COMMENT #18: CST asked that “breath alcohol ignition interlock device (BAIID)” and “device,” which are defined in the rule be used in lieu of “ignition interlock,” “interlock device,” and “ignition interlock device” which are undefined terms that are used in later rules. CST also asked that the term “driver,” which is used in other subsequent rules be replaced with the term “operator” that is defined in this rule. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The department agrees and will make the changes. 
COMMENT #19: Consumer Safety Technology, LLC (CST) requested to amend 7 CSR 60-2.010 to add a definition of the term “service center”. The definition would mean “A fixed location oper- ation of an authorized service provider that includes, but is not lim- ited to, installing, monitoring, maintaining, and removing breath alcohol ignition interlock devices.” CST did not give a reason to add this definition. 
RESPONSE: The department disagrees and the requested change will not be made because the ordinary meaning of “service center” 
(i.e., the location where service is provided) provides sufficient meaning under the rule. 
7 CSR 60-2.010 Definitions

7 CSR 60-2.020 is adopted. 
A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the text of the proposed rule was published in the Missouri Register on April 16, 2018 (43 MoReg 760–761). Those sections with changes are reprinted here. This proposed rule becomes effective thirty (30) days after publica- tion in the Code of State Regulations. 
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The commission received six (6) comments on the proposed rule. 
COMMENT #1: Smart Start, Inc. (SSI) requested to insert the phrase “The manufacturer shall” in 7 CSR 60-2.020(1) to clarify who is required to submit information required under the rule. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The department agrees to make this change. 
COMMENT #2: SSI requested to insert a new subsection (F) to 7 CSR 60-2.020(1) that would require a manufacturer to submit a

Orders of Rulemaking 

Quality Assurance Plan in accordance with Appendix A of the model specifications for ignition interlock devices to clarify the calibration process utilized by the manufacturer and to conform to the Model Guideline for State Ignition Interlock Programs published by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. 
RESPONSE: The department disagrees and will not make the request- ed change because a manufacturer must submit policies and proce- dures for device calibration under 7 CSR 60-2.020(1)(D). 
COMMENT #3: Consumer Safety Technology, LLC (CST) request- ed to amend 7 CSR 60-2.010 to add a definition of the term “service center”. The definition would mean “A fixed location operation of an authorized service provider that includes, but is not limited to, installing, monitoring, maintaining, and removing breath alcohol ignition interlock devices.” CST did not give a reason to add this definition. 
RESPONSE: The department disagrees and the requested change will not be made because the ordinary meaning of “service center” (i.e., the location where service is provided) provides sufficient meaning under the rule. 
COMMENT #4: CST requested to amend 7 CSR 60-2.020(1)(E)6. to define “moral turpitude” in order to provide guidance for what the term means, rather than leaving its meaning to manufacturer discre- tion. CST suggested adding a parenthetical with a list of the crimes that constitute moral turpitude. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The department agrees but will not make the suggested change. Rather, the depart- ment will replace the phrase “moral turpitude” with the following phrase, “an inherent quality of baseness, vileness, or depravity with respect to a person’s duty to another or to society in general.” The department will also replace “ensure that technicians do not have” with “perform reasonable background checks to avoid technicians with.” 
COMMENT #5: CST requested to amend 7 CSR 60-2.020(1)(F), (2)(A), and (3) to capitalize “division” because it is a defined term and replace “applicant” with “manufacturer” because “manufactur- er” is the defined term. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The department disagrees with capitalizing “division” and will not make this change because the secretary of state has previously requested this type of term to be lowercase. The department agrees to replace “applicant” with “manufacturer” because “manufacturer” is the defined term and this change will be made. 
COMMENT #6: CST asked that the term “driver” as used in this rule be replaced with the term “operator” that is defined in 7 CSR 60-2.010. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The department agrees and will make this change. 
7 CSR 60-2.020 Approval Procedure 
(1) The manufacturer shall submit the following information. (E) Submit a quality control plan that includes, but is not limited 
to: 1. A listing of the manufacturer’s management staff by full 
name and title, including management at the state, installation site, and service center levels; 
2. Training materials for technicians on the installation and cal- ibration of the device; 
3. Training materials for installation sites and service centers on how to explain or train operators on the use of the device; 
4. Training materials on the use of the device given to operators; 
5. Policies, procedures, and/or guidance concerning the super- vision of installation sites, service centers, and technicians in the state; 
manufacturer performs reasonable background checks to avoid tech- nicians with two (2) or more alcohol related enforcement contacts as defined in section 302.525, RSMo; or, a manslaughter, involuntary manslaughter, or any type of crime or conduct involving an inherent quality of baseness, vileness, or depravity with respect to a person’s duty to another or to society in general that would compromise the program; 
7. Policies, procedures, and/or guidance concerning discipli- nary action for authorized service providers and technicians that fail to meet requirements set forth in 7 CSR 60-2.030 through 7 CSR 60- 2.050 or any policies of the applicant; and 
8. A copy of the service and/or lease agreement given to oper- ators.

ORDER OF RULEMAKING 
By the authority vested in the Missouri Highways and Transportation Commission under sections 226.130, 302.060, 302.304, 302.309, 302.440–302.462, 302.525, 577.041, 577.600, 577.605, and 577.612, RSMo 2016 and RSMo Supp. 2017, the commission adopts a rule as follows: 
7 CSR 60-2.030 is adopted. 
A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the text of the proposed rule was published in the Missouri Register on April 16, 2018 (43 MoReg 761–766). Those sections with changes are reprinted here. This proposed rule becomes effective thirty (30) days after publica- tion in the Code of State Regulations. 
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The commission received twenty (20) comments on the proposed rule. 
6. Policies, procedures, and/or guidance that explain how the 
COMMENT #1: Smart Start, Inc. (SSI) gave a comment that supports 
 
September 17, 2018 Vol. 43, No. 18 
 
Missouri Register 
Page 2673 

the new mandate in paragraph 7 CSR 60-2.030(1)(A)2. that would require, as of January 1, 2019, that an ignition interlock manufacturer possess an ISO 9001 Certification to make or assemble a device certi- fied for Missouri use. SSI supports the language because it conforms to the “Manufacturer Oversight” Best Practice Recommendation of the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA) and because it “...will ensure the manufacturer adheres to an auditable, international standard that specifies requirements for a quality manage- ment system (QMS) and serves as a method for manufacturers to demonstrate the ability to consistently provide products and services that meet customer and regulatory requirements.” 
RESPONSE: The department will make no change to the rule as a result of this comment as no change was requested. 
COMMENT #2: Alcohol Detection Systems (ADS) opposes the January 1, 2019 ISO 9001 Certification requirement in 7 CSR 60- 2.030(1)(A)2. ADS believes this requirement intends to eliminate/prevent competing non-ISO 9001 devices from being in the Missouri market because ISO Certification can cost a manufacturer in excess of twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) per year, which is an unnecessary expense that ADS has not budgeted for. ADS also says it will drive up the cost to the end user. ADS asserts the ISO 9001 Certification process can take much longer than 6 months, so ADS may not be able to become certified prior to January 1, 2019. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The department agrees to change the rule to require that ignition interlock manufac- turers apply for ISO 9001 Certification before January 1, 2019, but obtain the Certification no later than July 1, 2019. 
COMMENT #3: ADS requested to delete the phrase, “and any refusal to take the breath test” in 7 CSR 60-2.030(1)(H)5. because it requires the capture of “random” images or images captured at unknown times, which may result in the device capturing “intended acts, including but not limited to inappropriate images.” ADS believes the capture of inappropriate images may expose the rule to privacy issues protected under the U.S. Constitution’s 4th Amendment. Also, this language implies that only a fixed mount camera can be utilized, which would require a significant financial investment in new hardware, since the ADS camera is mounted into the handheld portion of the breath alcohol ignition interlock device (BAIID). 
RESPONSE: The department disagrees and the change will not be made because the phrase cited by ADS does not require the BAIID to capture “random” images. Also, the department believes any pri- vacy concerns under the U.S. Constitution’s 4th Amendment are minimal. An operator’s expectation of privacy is not violated during the capture of intended or inappropriate acts performed in the occu- pant compartment of a vehicle operated on a public highway as those acts are within the “plain view” of the public and there is no legiti- mate expectation of privacy. This rule does not require use of a fixed mount camera. 
COMMENT #4: Consumer Safety Technology, LLC (CST) request- ed to amend 7 CSR 60-2.030(1)(A)1. to automatically incorporate into the rule any subsequent amendment or additions to the Model Specifications for Breath Alcohol Ignition Interlock Devices to avoid future rule amendments each time the model specifications are updat- ed. 
RESPONSE: The department disagrees and the suggested change will not be made because section 536.031.4, RSMo, prohibits this practice. 
COMMENT #5: CST requested to replace “Department” with “Division” in 7 CSR 60-2.030(1)(A)3. because the division provides device certification. RESPONSE: The department disagrees and the suggested change will not be made. Although the division handles device certification, the decision is made on behalf of the department. 
COMMENT #6: CST requested to capitalize “division” in 7 CSR 60-2.030(1)(A)5. since it is a defined term. RESPONSE: The department disagrees and will not make this change because the secretary of state has previously requested this type of term to be lowercase. 
COMMENT #7: CST requested to replace “random test” in para- graph 7 CSR 60-2.030(1)(A)6. with the defined term “running retest.” CST did not give a reason for the change. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The department agrees and the changes will be made. 
COMMENT #8: CST requested to delete “Breath Alcohol Concentration” from 7 CSR 60-2.030(1)(B)2. since “BrAC” appears in the section, and it is the acronym for the defined term. RESPONSE: The department disagrees and will not make this change because the secretary of state has previously requested an acronym to be spelled out the first time it is used in each rule. 
COMMENT #9: CST requested to delete the phrase “and any act or attempt to tamper or circumvent a device,” from 7 CSR 60- 2.030(1)(B)4. since that language appears in the definition of “Violations reset.” 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The department agrees and the change will be made. 
COMMENT #10: CST requested to delete the term “Alcohol retest setpoint” consistent with its previous comments to 7 CSR 60-2.010 and delete “retest” throughout subsection (1)(D). RESPONSE: The department disagrees and these changes will not be made. 
COMMENT #11: CST requested to make minor, non-substantive grammatical changes to 7 CSR 60-2.030(1)(D)3. CST did not give a reason for the change. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: While CST did not give a reason for the changes, the department agrees and will make the changes because it improves the flow of the sentence. 
COMMENT #12: CST requested to delete the phrase “the vehicle’s horn, or other installed alarm” in 7 CSR 60-2.030(1)(D)4. and replace it with the phrase “an internal alarm.” CST reasoned that an internal alarm installed within the passenger compartment of the vehicle would be safer and easier to activate than an external horn. CST said that activating a horn on newer or “exotic” vehicles can be problematic and result in costly repairs. 
RESPONSE: The department disagrees and the change will not be made. 
COMMENT #13: CST requested to delete “Authorized Service Provider” (ASP) in 7 CSR 60-2.030(1)(D)4. and retain only the acronym “ASP” as this acronym is already cited in the definition of “Authorized Service Provider” in the definitions rule. 
RESPONSE: The department disagrees and will not make this change because the secretary of state has previously requested an acronym to be spelled out the first time it is used in each rule. 
COMMENT #14: CST requested to delete 7 CSR 60-2.030(1)(F)5. and amend 7 CSR 60-2.030(1)(F)3. and 4. to eliminate a “wet bath” as an acceptable method of calibration and to create an alcohol ref- erence value between .020 and .050 + 10 percent of the alcohol ref- erence value. CST asserts wet baths are difficult to maintain and are unreliable if improperly maintained. CST did not provide any ratio- nale for its change to create an alcohol reference value between .020 and .050 + 10 percent of the alcohol reference value. 
RESPONSE: The department disagrees and the requested changes will not be made. Two (2) manufacturers currently utilize wet bath simulators for calibration and eliminating them could cause financial

Orders of Rulemaking 

and logistical challenges for those manufacturers. In addition, a + 10 percent alcohol reference value allows for too large of a margin of error. The rule’s proposed reference value of + .050 BrAC is utilized by the Missouri Safety Center and is accepted by the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. 
COMMENT #15: CST requested to amend 7 CSR 60-2.030(1)(G)6. so that if a limited driving privilege is not under a five- (5-) or ten- (10-) year denial, then only a court or Missouri statute can mandate the use of photo identification or digital images and only a court can mandate the use of global positioning system (GPS) data. CST asserts this is consistent with section 302.060, RSMo. 
RESPONSE: The department disagrees and the requested changes will not be made as the proposed rulemaking has been reviewed by legal counsel for the Department of Revenue, and such legal counsel believes the rule language is consistent with section 302.060, RSMo. 
COMMENT #16: CST requested to amend 7 CSR 60-2.030(1)(H) to be consistent with section 302.060, RSMo for the same reason as set forth in Comment #15 immediately above. RESPONSE: For the same reason as Comment #15, the department disagrees and the requested changes will not be made. 
COMMENT #17: CST requested to amend 7 CSR 60-2.030(1)(H)5. to more simply define when photo identification or digital images are required and add a requirement for a photo identification or digital image when there is any circumvention or tampering. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The department disagrees with the changes to simplify the language as the more spe- cific language for photo identification/digital image is preferred; however, the department agrees to make the change to require photo identification or digital images for circumvention and tampering. 
COMMENT #18: CST requested to amend 7 CSR 60-2.030(1)(I)5. based upon section 302.060, RSMo so that only a court or Missouri statute can require photo identification or digital imaging and only a court can mandate the use of global positioning system (GPS) data. RESPONSE: The department disagrees and the suggested change will not be made. 
COMMENT #19: CST asked that the term “driver” as used in this rule be replaced with the term “operator,” which is a term that is defined in 7 CSR 60-2.010. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The department agrees and will make this change. 
COMMENT 20: Donald DeBoard, State Ignition Interlock Coordinator, University of Central Missouri, requested that 7 CSR 60-2.030(1)(F)2. be modified to read “Calibrate devices at least every thirty (30) days, + seven (7) days, or during each monitoring service.” 
RESPONSE: The department will not make the change because the suggested language was already incorporated into the proposed rule- making. 
7 CSR 60-2.030 Standards and Specifications 
(1) Device standards and specifications. To be certified, a breath alcohol ignition interlock device must—

a rule as follows: 
agrees with this comment and will make the change to the rule. 
COMMENT #4: CST requested to amend 7 CSR 60-2.050(1)(K) to add the word “monitoring” to the list of work activities an ASP may perform on an ignition interlock device to be consistent with the changes made to the definition of “ASP” in 7 CSR 60-2.010. CST also asked to remove the word “repaired” from the list of work activ- ities as repair of a device is reserved for the device manufacturer and asked to insert the term “removed.” 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The department agrees with this comment and will make the changes to the rule. 
COMMENT #5: CST requested to amend 7 CSR 60-2.050(1)(N) to change the words, “lockout override” as those words are used in this rule to “override lockout” because the term “override lockout” is the defined term in the definitions rule, 7 CSR 60-2.010. CST also asked to reduce the time that an override lockout is valid from twenty-four (24) hours to three (3) hours. CST asserts this allows an appointment to be set and provides enough time for the operator to go directly to the service center. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The department agrees with this comment and will make the changes to the rule. 
7 CSR 60-2.050 Breath Alcohol Ignition Interlock Device Security 
(1) A manufacturer shall require and take steps to ensure that its authorized service providers— 
(F) Take reasonable steps to prevent the operator or any other unauthorized person from obtaining access to installation materials and/or from observing the installation, monitoring, maintenance, or removal of a device; 
(K) Document vehicle mileage as displayed on the vehicle odome- ter when a device is installed, monitored, maintained, and/or removed; 
(N) Do not sell or use any type of remote code or reset feature that allows the operator to bypass a device without providing all required breath tests. An override lockout may be provided under the follow- ing conditions: 
1. The override lockout must be unique to the device; 
2. All requirements outlined in 7 CSR 60-2.030 through 7 CSR 60-2.050 apply; 
3. The override lockout will not be valid for more than three (3) hours upon which the device will enter a permanent lockout status; and 
4. Each override lockout will be uniquely recorded in the data storage system;

ORDER OF RULEMAKING 
By the authority vested in the Missouri Highways and Transportation Commission under sections 226.130, 302.060, 302.304, 302.309, 302.440–302.462, 302.525, 577.041, 577.600, 577.605, and 577.612, RSMo 2016 and RSMo Supp. 2017, the commission rescinds a rule as follows: 
7 CSR 60-2.060 Suspension, or Revocation of Approval of a Device is rescinded. 
7 CSR 60-2.050 is adopted. 
A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the text of the proposed rule was published in the Missouri Register on April 16, 2018 (43 MoReg 769). Those sections with changes are reprinted here. This proposed rule becomes effective thirty (30) days after publication in the Code of State Regulations. 
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The commission received five (5) comments on the proposed rule. 
COMMENT #1: Alcohol Detection Systems (ADS) requested 7 CSR 60-2.050(1)(A) be amended to require authorized service providers to require its installers and service centers to carry minimum insur- ance tort liability coverage of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) to cover damage and loss to the operator’s vehicle and personal proper- ty if under the care of an installer/service center. ADS believes that the proposed rule’s minimum general liability insurance limits of three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000) per occurrence and six hundred thousand dollars ($600,000) in the aggregate will reduce the number of smaller installers and service centers that will provide ignition interlock service, which will reduce competition in these smaller markets and require increased travel for offenders to service their ignition interlock devices. This will reduce the number of offenders participating in the Ignition Interlock program. Also, the increased cost of the insurance for the installers/service centers will be passed along to offenders. 
RESPONSE: The department will not make any change to the rule based on this comment. The minimum insurance requirements for authorized installers/service centers were based on insurance guid- ance and minimum limits provided by Missouri insurance providers who offer business insurance coverage. The information provided by these insurance companies indicated that a minimum coverage amount of three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000) per event and six hundred thousand dollars ($600,000) in the aggregate was the lowest coverage offered. 
COMMENT #2: Consumer Safety Technology, LLC (CST) request- ed to amend 7 CSR 60-2.050(1)(A) to reduce the rule’s proposed three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000) per occurrence and six hundred thousand dollars ($600,000) aggregate insurance limits to one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) per occurrence and three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000) in the aggregate. CST asserts this is based on a garage keepers’ liability insurance policy designed to cover bodily injury and property damage caused by an accident arising out of a garage business operation. These amounts are ade- quate as the ignition interlock device manufacturer has product lia- bility coverage of $1 million per occurrence and $3 million in the aggregate for design and material defects and design manufacturing, calibration, installation, and removal. 
RESPONSE: The department will not make any change to the rule based on this comment. The minimum insurance requirements for authorized installers/service centers were based on insurance guid- ance and minimum limits provided by Missouri insurance providers who offer business insurance coverage. The information provided by these insurance companies indicated that a minimum coverage amount of three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000) per event and six hundred thousand dollars ($600,000) in the aggregate was the lowest coverage offered. 
COMMENT #3: CST requested to amend 7 CSR 60-2.050(1)(F) to include “monitoring and maintenance” to the list of activities that an operator or any other unauthorized person shall not observe when an authorized service provider (ASP) is installing, removing, or other- wise maintaining the ignition interlock device based on the definition of “authorized service provider” in 7 CSR 60-2.010.

ORDER OF RULEMAKING 
By the authority vested in the Missouri Highways and Transportation Commission under sections 226.130, 302.060, 302.304, 302.309, 302.440–302.462, 302.525, 577.041, 577.600, 577.605, and 577.612, RSMo 2016 and RSMo Supp. 2017, the commission adopts a rule as follows: 
7 CSR 60-2.060 is adopted. 
A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the text of the proposed rule was published in the Missouri Register on April 16, 2018 (43 MoReg 770–771). Those sections with changes are reprinted here. This proposed rule becomes effective thirty (30) days after publica- tion in the Code of State Regulations. 
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The commission received five (5) comments on the proposed rule. 
COMMENT #1: Consumer Safety Technology, LLC (CST) request- ed to amend 7 CSR 60-2.060(2)(C)1. to automatically incorporate into the rule any subsequent amendment or additions to the Model Specifications for Breath Alcohol Ignition Interlock Devices to avoid future rule amendments each time the model specifications are updat- ed. 
RESPONSE: The department disagrees and the change will not be made because section 536.031.4, RSMo, prohibits this practice. 
COMMENT #2: CST requested to add to 7 CSR 60-2.060(2) a new subsection (J) so that if a manufacturer’s device is sanctioned, disap- proved, revoked, or cancelled in another state or jurisdiction, such a circumstance warrants suspension and/or decertification in Missouri as well. CST did not give a reason for this change. 
RESPONSE: The department disagrees and the suggested change will not be made, since the proposed rulemaking already includes a similar provision in 7 CSR 60-2.040(2)(I). 
COMMENT #3: CST requested to add to 7 CSR 60-2.060(3)(D) a requirement that a manufacturer provide a one hundred thousand dol- lar ($100,000) performance bond to replace the manufacturer’s igni- tion interlock device if it is suspended or decertified. CST did not give a reason for this change. 
RESPONSE: The department disagrees and the suggested change will not be made, since there is no history in Missouri of a manufac- turer not covering the cost of removing a suspended or decertified breath alcohol ignition interlock device (BAIID). 
COMMENT #4: Smart Start, Inc. (SSI) requested to amend 7 CSR 60-2.060(2)(G) to require the department receive multiple operator complaints concerning proper BAIID operation before a device may be suspended and/or decertified. SSI believes this change would be con- sistent with language in earlier 7 CSR 60-2.060(2)(E) that requires 
multiple device malfunctions and/or failures before a device may be suspended and/or decertified. RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The department agrees and the change will be made as a result of this comment. 
COMMENT #5: SSI requested to amend 7 CSR 60-2.060(3)(C) to insert the phrase “chosen by the offender” in order to allow the oper- ator to choose the certified BAIID that shall replace the BAIID that was suspended or decertified. SSI believes the client/offender should be able to select the BAIID and will not require the entity whose BAIID was suspended/decertified to sell the offender’s BAIID con- tract to a competitor. 
RESPONSE AND EXPLANATION OF CHANGE: The department agrees and the change will be made as a result of this comment. 
7 CSR 60-2.060 Device Suspension and Decertification 
(2) Circumstances warranting suspension and/or decertification include, but are not limited to: 
(G) Validated complaints from multiple operators concerning prop- er device operation; 
(3) Cost. In the event of suspension or decertification, the manufac- turer will be responsible for all compliance costs associated with 7 CSR 60-2.010 through 7 CSR 60-2.060 including, but not limited to: 
(C) Installation of a new device chosen by the offender on the offender’s vehicle;

Commission under section 622.027, RSMo 2016, the commission amends a rule as follows: 
7 CSR 265-8.040 Transportation of Employees is amended. 
A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the text of the proposed amendment was published in the Missouri Register on April 16, 2018 (43 MoReg 747–748). No changes have been made in the text of the proposed amendment, so it is not reprinted here. This proposed amendment becomes effective thirty (30) days after publication in the Code of State Regulations. 
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The commission received two (2) comments on the proposed amendment. 
COMMENT #1: Jason Hayden, State Legislative Director for the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers (SMART) asked that this rule be further amended to require the rule to apply to taxicabs and any other vehicles used by a railroad company to transport its employees. SMART believes this change would protect the safety of railroad employees. 
RESPONSE: The current rule became effective in 1985 and specifi- cally does not apply its mandates to taxi cabs, thus SMART’s requested change would expand the application of the rule. Also, this rule was promulgated pursuant to section 389.945.1, RSMo which states in relevant part: “The...division... shall make...safety rules and regulations relating to motor vehicles...used by common carriers by rail to transport employees...to and from their places of employment or during the course of their employment.” The phrase ‘used by com- mon carriers’ seems to exclude taxi cabs and were the department to adopt SMART’s requested change it may very well exceed its statu- tory authority. No changes were made to the amended rule as a result of this comment. 
COMMENT #2: SMART also asks to amend the rule to require a minimum of $1 million in automobile insurance coverage (and unin- sured and underinsured coverage) to protect railroad employee occu- pants in cases of accidents. SMART says a number of states provide this insurance requirement. 
RESPONSE: The department has tried to follow the guidance in the governor’s Executive Order 17-03, which asked state agencies to identify regulations that reduce jobs, stifle entrepreneurship, limit innovation, or impose costs far in excess of their benefits. The department is not willing to make changes to the rule that may impose costs far in excess of the benefits and this change requested in the public comment requiring $1 million in insurance would seem to do this. No changes were made as a result of this comment.

SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The board received one (1) com- ment on the proposed amendment. 
COMMENT: A comment was received from the Missouri Association of Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons (MAOPS) opposing the proposed amendment. Brian Bowles, Executive Director submitted the comments on behalf of the nearly three thou- sand (3,000) physicians they represent in the state of Missouri. MAOPS opposes changes to the mileage limitations between a col- laborating physician and an advanced practice registered nurse to sev- enty-five (75) miles by road and expressed concern regarding the use of emergency rulemaking procedures for this unnecessary change. MAOPS further stated they feel the current fifty- (50-) mile limita- tion is adequate. MAOPS’ position is that the fifty-mile limitation was put in place to protect the patient AND the collaborating physi- cian and APRN. It allows for a more rapid response of a collaborat- ing physician in case of emergency, so the patient can receive appro- priate medical care. Expanding this distance jeopardizes patient safe- ty. Equally important, expanding this distance jeopardizes the collab- orative relationship, not only for the collaborating physician who has placed his/her license on the line in order to provide expanded access in the first place, but for the APRN who has willingly agreed to prac- tice under the terms specified in the agreement. MAOPS worries that fewer physicians will be willing to risk their license as restrictions are weakened, thus exacerbating the access to care issue for which this rule was promulgated. MAOPS further states that we cannot forget that physicians are essentially loaning their licenses to APRNs to allow them to practice independently without direct supervision. The physician licenses need to be protected and the Board of Healing Arts has a duty to ensure this, in order that patients have access to quality medical care when needed. MAOPS further states that no mileage restriction is in place for collaborating physicians and APRNs using telemedicine. This was passed in statute and promulgated in rule sev- eral years ago to “solve” the mileage issue of concern to the nurses. MAOPS questions the motivation of a rule to increase the mileage restriction to seventy-five (75) miles, when an avenue already exists for unlimited mileage. If collaborating physicians and APRNs do not have the technology or knowledge to effectively use telemedicine in their collaboration, shouldn’t we question the wisdom of increasing the mileage restriction to accommodate them? Addressing the deci- sion that this be promulgated as an emergency rule, MAOPS feels strongly that this was a politically motivated decision, and not in the best interest of patients or of the collaborating physicians and APRNs. MAOPS states that they know of no data that suggests that 1) the fifty- (50-) mile restriction is posing a public health threat, or 2) that increasing it to seventy-five (75) miles will solve the access to

Orders of Rulemaking 

care issue cited. Lacking such data, MAOPS questions the necessity of the emergency rule, and are concerned with the precedent this sets for future emergency rulemaking. Again, current law allows for no mileage restriction if telemedicine is used in the collaboration, mak- ing not only the emergency rule, but the rule in general, unnecessary. However, if the board feels the need to promulgate this rule, MAOPS asks that it be made very clear in the rule that the collaborating physi- cian has the sole discretion to choose whatever mileage limitation they feel comfortable with, up to seventy-five (75) miles. RESPONSE: The board appreciates the comment received from MAOPS and reiterates this amendment was a difficult discussion for the board and the changes were made in good faith. The board believes that collaborative practice protects the health, welfare, and safety of the public. The board is not interested in making any further changes that they believe will compromise Missouri citizens. No changes have been made to the rule as a result of this comment.
