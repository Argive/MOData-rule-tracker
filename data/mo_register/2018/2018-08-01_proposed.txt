HOW TO CITE RULES AND RSMO 
RULES 
The rules are codified in the Code of State Regulations in this system– 
Title Division Chapter Rule 
3 CSR 10- 4 .115 Department Code of Agency General area Specific area 
State Division regulated regulated Regulations 
and should be cited in this manner: 3 CSR 10-4.115. 
Each department of state government is assigned a title. Each agency or division in the department is assigned a division number. The agency then groups its rules into general subject matter areas called chapters and specific areas called rules. Within a rule, the first breakdown is called a section and is designated as (1). Subsection is (A) with further breakdown into paragraphs 1., subparagraphs A., parts (I), subparts (a), items I. and subitems a. 
The rule is properly cited by using the full citation, for example, 3 CSR 10-4.115 NOT Rule 10-4.115. Citations of RSMo are to the Missouri Revised Statutes as of the date indicated.

Emergency Rules 
MISSOURI REGISTER 

Rules appearing under this heading are filed under the authority granted by section 536.025, RSMo 2000. An emergency rule may be adopted by an agency if the agency finds that an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare, or a compelling governmental interest requires emergency action; follows procedures best calculated to assure fairness to all interested persons and parties under the circumstances; follows procedures which comply with the protections extended by the Missouri and the United States Constitutions; limits the scope of such rule to the circum- stances creating an emergency and requiring emergency procedure, and at the time of or prior to the adoption of such rule files with the secretary of state the text of the rule togeth- er with the specific facts, reasons, and findings which support its conclusion that there is an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare which can be met only through the adoption of such rule and its reasons for concluding that the procedure employed is fair to all interested persons and par- ties under the circumstances. 
Rules filed as emergency rules may be effective not less than ten (10) days after filing or at such later date as may be specified in the rule and may be terminated at any time by the state agency by filing an order with the secretary of state fixing the date of such termination, which order shall be published by the secretary of state in the Missouri Register as soon as practicable. 
All emergency rules must state the period during which they are in effect, and in no case can they be in effect more than one hundred eighty (180) calendar days or thirty (30) legislative days, whichever period is longer. Emergency rules are not renewable, although an agency may at any time adopt an identical rule under the normal rulemaking proce- dures. 
Title 13—DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES Division 70—MO HealthNet Division Chapter 15—Hospital Program 
EMERGENCY AMENDMENT 
13 CSR 70-15.010 Inpatient Hospital Services Reimbursement Plan; Outpatient Hospital Services Reimbursement Methodology. The division is amending subsections (3)(B) and (15)(B). 
PURPOSE: This amendment provides for the State Fiscal Year (SFY) 2019 trend factor to be applied in determining Federal Reimbursement Allowance (FRA) funded hospital payments for SFY 2019 along with updates to the calculation of the SFY 2019 Direct Medicaid payments. 
EMERGENCY STATEMENT: The Department of Social Services, MO HealthNet Division (MHD) finds that this emergency amendment is necessary to preserve a compelling governmental interest of collect- ing state revenue in order to provide health care to individuals eligi- ble for the MO HealthNet program and for the uninsured. An early effective date is required because this emergency amendment estab- lishes the Federal Reimbursement Allowance (FRA) funded hospital payments for dates of service beginning July 1, 2018 in regulation to ensure that quality health care continues to be provided to MO HealthNet participants and indigent patients at hospitals that have relied on MO HealthNet payments to meet those patients’ needs. The division uses the best information available for the trend for the 
upcoming state fiscal year so it is using the trend published in the First Quarter Healthcare Cost Review publication which is generally not available until May. The division must also analyze hospital data, which is not complete until near the end of the state fiscal year, in conjunction with the trend and funding to determine the appropriate level of payments. Without this information, the trends cannot be determined; therefore, due to timing of the receipt of this information and the necessary July 1, 2018 effective date, an emergency regula- tion is necessary. As a result, the MHD finds an immediate danger to public health and welfare which requires emergency actions. If this emergency amendment is not enacted, there would be significant cash flow shortages causing a financial strain on Missouri hospitals which serve approximately nine hundred seventy-one thousand (971,000) MO HealthNet participants plus the uninsured. This financial strain, in turn, will result in an adverse impact on the health, safety, and welfare of MO HealthNet participants and uninsured individuals in need of medical treatment. This emergency amendment limits its scope to the circumstances creating the emergency and complies with the protections extended by the Missouri and United States Constitutions. The MHD believes this emergency amendment to be fair to all interested persons and parties under the circumstances. The emergency amendment was filed June 21, 2018, becomes effective July 1, 2018, and expires February 28, 2019. 
(3) Per Diem Reimbursement Rate Computation. Each hospital shall receive a MO HealthNet per diem rate based on the following com- putation: 
(B) Trend Indices (TI). Trend indices are determined based on the four- (4-) quarter average DRI Index for DRI-Type Hospital Market Basket as published in Health Care Costs by DRI/McGraw-Hill for each State Fiscal Year (SFY) 1995 to 1998. Trend indices starting in SFY 1999 will be determined based on CPI Hospital index as pub- lished in Health Care Costs by DRI/McGraw-Hill, or equivalent pub- lication, regardless of any changes in the name of the publication or publisher, for each State Fiscal Year (SFY). Trend indices starting in SFY 2016 will be determined based on the Hospital Market Basket index as published in Healthcare Cost Review by Institute of Health Systems (IHS), or equivalent publication, regardless of any changes in the name of the publication or publisher, for each State Fiscal Year (SFY). 
1. The TI are— A. SFY 1994—4.6% B. SFY 1995—4.45% C. SFY 1996—4.575% D. SFY 1997—4.05% E. SFY 1998—3.1% F. SFY 1999—3.8% G. SFY 2000—4.0% H. SFY 2001—4.6% I. SFY 2002—4.8% J. SFY 2003—5.0% K. SFY 2004—6.2% L. SFY 2005—6.7% M. SFY 2006—5.7% N. SFY 2007—5.9% O. SFY 2008—5.5% P. SFY 2009—5.5% Q. SFY 2010—3.9% R. SFY 2011—3.2%—The 3.2% trend shall not be applied in 
determining the per diem rate, Direct Medicaid payments, or unin- sured payments. 
S. SFY 2012—4.0% T. SFY 2013—4.4% U. SFY 2014—3.7% V. SFY 2015—4.3% W. SFY 2016—2.5%

Emergency Rules 

X. SFY 2017—2.7% Y. SFY 2018—3.2% Z. SFY 2019—2.8% 
2. The TI for SFY 1996 through SFY 1998 are applied as a full percentage to the OC of the per diem rate and for SFY 1999 the OC of the June 30, 1998, rate shall be trended by 1.2% and for SFY 2000 the OC of the June 30, 1999, rate shall be trended by 2.4%. The OC of the June 30, 2000, rate shall be trended by 1.95% for SFY 2001. 
3. The per diem rate shall be reduced as necessary to avoid any negative Direct Medicaid payments computed in accordance with subsection (15)(B). 
4. A facility previously enrolled for participation in the MO HealthNet Program, which either voluntarily or involuntarily termi- nates its participation in the MO HealthNet Program and which reen- ters the MO HealthNet Program, will receive the same inpatient rate and outpatient rate as the previous owner/operator. Such facility will also receive the same Direct Medicaid Add-On Payment and Uninsured Add-On Payment as the previous owner/operator if the facility reenters the MO HealthNet Program during the same state fiscal year. If the facility does not reenter during the same state fiscal year, the Direct Medicaid Add-On Payment and Uninsured Add-On Payment will be determined based on the applicable base year data (i.e., fourth prior year cost report for the Direct Medicaid Payment; see 13 CSR 70-15.220 for the applicable data for the Uninsured Add- On Payment). If the facility does not have the applicable base year data, the Direct Medicaid Add-On Payment and the Uninsured Add- On Payment will be based on the most recent audited data available and will include annual trend factor adjustments from the year sub- sequent to the cost report period through the state fiscal year for which the payments are being determined. 
(15) Direct Medicaid Payments. (B) Direct Medicaid payment will be computed as follows: 
1. The MO HealthNet share of the inpatient FRA assessment will be calculated by dividing the hospital’s inpatient Medicaid patient days by the total inpatient hospital patient days from the hos- pital’s base cost report to arrive at the inpatient Medicaid utilization percentage. This percentage is then multiplied by the inpatient FRA assessment for the current SFY to arrive at the increased allowable MO HealthNet costs for the inpatient FRA assessment. The MO HealthNet share of the outpatient FRA assessment will be calculated by dividing the hospital’s outpatient MO HealthNet charges by the total outpatient hospital charges from the base cost report to arrive at the MO HealthNet utilization percentage. This percentage is then multiplied by the outpatient FRA assessment for the current SFY to arrive at the increased allowable MO HealthNet costs for the outpa- tient FRA assessment. 
A. Effective for payments made on or after May 1, 2017, only the Fee-for-Service and Out-of-State components of the MO HealthNet share of both the inpatient and outpatient FRA assessment will be included in the Direct Medicaid add-on payment. 
2. The unreimbursed MO HealthNet costs are determined by subtracting the hospital’s per diem rate from its trended per diem costs. The difference is multiplied by the estimated MO HealthNet patient days for the current SFY plus the out-of-state days from the fourth prior year cost report trended to the current SFY. The estimat- ed MO HealthNet patient days for the current SFY shall be the better of the sum of the Fee-for-Service (FFS) days plus managed care days or the days used in the prior SFY’s Direct Medicaid payment calcu- lation. The FFS days are determined from a regression analysis of the hospital’s FFS days from February 1999 through December of the second prior SFY. The managed care days are based on the FFS days determined from the regression analysis, as follows: The FFS days are factored up by the percentage of FFS days to the total of FFS days plus managed care days from the hospital’s fourth prior year cost report. The difference between the FFS days and the FFS days fac- tored up by the FFS days’ percentage are the managed care days. 
A. Effective January 1, 2010, the estimated MO HealthNet patient days shall be the better of the sum of the FFS days plus man- aged care days or the days used in the prior SFY’s Direct Medicaid payment calculation (i.e., for SFY 2010, prior SFY would be SFY 2009) adjusted downward by twenty-five percent (25%) of the differ- ence between the sum of the FFS days plus managed care days and the days used in the prior SFY’s Direct Medicaid payment calcula- tion. 
(I) The FFS days plus managed care days are determined as follows: The FFS days are determined by applying a trend to the second prior Calendar Year (CY) days (i.e., for SFY 2010, second prior CY would be 2008) as determined from the state’s Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS). The trend is determined from a regression analysis of the hospital’s FFS days from February 1999 through December of the second prior CY. The managed care days are based on the FFS days determined from the regression analysis, as follows: The FFS days are factored up by the percentage of FFS days to the total of FFS days plus managed care days from the hospital’s fourth prior year cost report. The difference between the FFS days and the FFS days factored up by the FFS days’ percentage are the managed care days. 
(II) The days used in the prior SFY’s Direct Medicaid pay- ment calculation adjusted downward by twenty-five percent (25%) are determined as follows: The days used in the prior SFY’s Direct Medicaid payment calculation are compared to the sum of the FFS days plus managed care days as determined in part (15)(B)2.A.(I). If the hospital has greater estimated days as used in the prior SFY’s Direct Medicaid payment calculation than the sum of the FFS days plus managed care days as determined in part (15)(B)2.A.(I), the dif- ference between the days is multiplied by twenty-five percent (25%), and this amount is removed from the estimated days used in the prior SFY’s Direct Medicaid payment calculation to arrive at the current year’s estimated days. 
B. Effective July 1, 2010, the estimated MO HealthNet patient days shall be the better of the sum of the FFS days plus man- aged care days or the days used in the SFY 2009 Direct Medicaid payment calculation adjusted downward by fifty percent (50%) of the difference between the sum of the FFS days plus managed care days and the days used in the SFY 2009 Direct Medicaid payment calcu- lation. 
(I) The FFS days plus managed care days are determined as set forth in part (15)(B)2.A.(I). 
(II) The days used in the prior SFY’s Direct Medicaid pay- ment calculation adjusted downward by fifty percent (50%) are deter- mined as follows: The days used in the prior SFY’s Direct Medicaid payment calculation are compared to the sum of the FFS days plus managed care days as determined in part (15)(B)2.A.(I). If the hos- pital has greater estimated days as used in the prior SFY’s Direct Medicaid payment calculation than the sum of the FFS days plus managed care days as determined in part (15)(B)2.A.(I), the differ- ence between the days is multiplied by fifty percent (50%) and this amount is removed from the estimated days used in the prior SFY’s Direct Medicaid payment calculation to arrive at the current year’s estimated days. 
C. Effective July 1, 2011, the estimated MO HealthNet patient days shall be the better of the sum of the FFS days plus man- aged care days or the days used in the SFY 2009 Direct Medicaid payment calculation adjusted downward by seventy-five percent (75%) of the difference between the sum of the FFS days plus man- aged care days and the days used in the SFY 2009 Direct Medicaid payment calculation. 
(I) The FFS days plus managed care days are determined as set forth in part (15)(B)2.A.(I). 
(II) The days used in the prior SFY’s Direct Medicaid pay- ment calculation adjusted downward by seventy-five percent (75%) are determined as follows: The days used in the prior SFY’s Direct Medicaid payment calculation are compared to the sum of the FFS days plus managed care days as determined in part (15)(B)2.A.(I). If

the hospital has greater estimated days as used in the prior SFY’s Direct Medicaid payment calculation than the sum of the FFS days plus managed care days as determined in part (15)(B)2.A.(I), the dif- ference between the days is multiplied by seventy-five percent (75%) and this amount is removed from the estimated days used in the prior SFY’s Direct Medicaid payment calculation to arrive at the current year’s estimated days. 
D. Effective July 1, 2012, the estimated MO HealthNet patient days shall be the sum of the FFS days plus managed care days. The FFS days plus managed care days are determined as set forth in part (15)(B)2.A.(I). 
E. Effective for payments made on or after May 1, 2017, the estimated MO HealthNet patient days for the SFY shall be deter- mined by adjusting the FFS days from the state’s MMIS for the sec- ond prior Calendar Year (CY) (i.e., for SFY 2017, second prior CY would be 2015) by: 
(I) The trend determined from a regression analysis of the hospital’s FFS days from February 1999 through December of the second prior CY; and 
(II) The days estimated to shift from FFS to managed care effective May 1, 2017. The estimated managed care days for popula- tions added to managed care beginning May 1, 2017 will be subtract- ed from the trended FFS days to yield the estimated MO HealthNet patient days. 
F. Effective for payments made on or after July 1, 2018, the estimated MO HealthNet patient days for the SFY shall be determined by adjusting the FFS days from the state’s MMIS for the second prior Calendar Year (CY) (i.e., for SFY 2019, second prior CY would be 2017) by: 
(I) The trend determined from a regression analysis of the hospital’s FFS days from February 1999 through December of the second prior CY; 
(II) A percentage adjustment shall be applied to the regression due to statewide managed care; 
(III) The FFS days are factored up by the percentage of FFS days to the total of FFS days plus managed care days from the hospital’s fourth prior year cost report to yield the estimated MO HealthNet patient days; and 
(IV) From the total estimated MO HealthNet patient days, remove the SFY 2019 estimated managed care days to yield the estimated MO HealthNet FFS patient days. 
[F.]G. The trended cost per day is calculated by trending the base year costs per day by the trend indices listed in paragraph (3)(B)1., using the rate calculation in subsection (3)(A). In addition to the trend indices applied to inflate base period costs to the current fiscal year, base year costs will be further adjusted by a Missouri Specific Trend. The Missouri Specific Trend will be used to address the fact that costs for Missouri inpatient care of MO HealthNet resi- dents have historically exceeded the compounded inflation rates esti- mated using national hospital indices for a significant number of hos- pitals. The Missouri Specific Trend will be applied at one and one- half percent (1.5%) per year to the hospital’s base year. For example, hospitals with a 1998 base year will receive an additional six percent (6%) trend, and hospitals with a 1999 base year will receive an addi- tional four and one-half percent (4.5%) trend. 
(I) Effective for dates of service beginning July 1, 2010, the Missouri Specific Trend shall no longer be applied to inflate base period costs. 
[G.]H. For hospitals that meet the requirements in paragraphs (6)(A)1., (6)(A)2., and (6)(A)4. of this rule (safety net hospitals), the base year cost report may be from the third prior year, the fourth prior year, or the fifth prior year. For hospitals that meet the require- ments in paragraphs (6)(A)1. and (6)(A)3. of this rule (first tier Disproportionate Share Hospitals), the base year operating costs may be the third or fourth prior year cost report. The MO HealthNet Division shall exercise its sole discretion as to which report is most representative of costs. For all other hospitals, the base year operat- ing costs are based on the fourth prior year cost report. For any hos- 
pital that has both a twelve- (12-) month cost report and a partial year cost report, its base period cost report for that year will be the twelve- (12-) month cost report. 
[H.]I. The trended cost per day does not include the costs associated with the FRA assessment, the application of minimum uti- lization, the utilization adjustment, and the poison control costs com- puted in paragraphs (15)(B)1., 3., 4., and 5.; 
3. The minimum utilization costs for capital and medical educa- tion is calculated by determining the difference in the hospital’s cost per day when applying the minimum utilization, as identified in para- graph (5)(C)4., and without applying the minimum utilization. The difference in the cost per day is multiplied by the estimated MO HealthNet patient days for the SFY; 
4. The utilization adjustment cost is determined by estimating the number of MO HealthNet inpatient days the hospital will not pro- vide as a result of the managed care health plans limiting inpatient hospital services. These days are multiplied by the hospital’s cost per day to determine the total cost associated with these days. This cost is divided by the remaining total patient days from its base period cost report to arrive at the increased cost per day. This increased cost per day is multiplied by the estimated MO HealthNet days for the current SFY to arrive at the MO HealthNet utilization adjustment. 
A. Effective January 1, 2010, hospitals other than safety net hospitals as defined in subsection (6)(B) will receive sixty-seven per- cent (67%) of the utilization adjustment calculated in accordance with paragraph (15)(B)4. Safety net hospitals will continue to receive one hundred percent (100%) of the adjustment calculated in accor- dance with paragraph (15)(B)4. 
B. Effective July 1, 2010, hospitals other than safety net hos- pitals as defined in subsection (6)(B), children’s hospitals as defined in subsection (2)(S), and specialty pediatric hospitals as defined in subsection (2)(P) will receive thirty-four percent (34%) of the utiliza- tion adjustment calculated in accordance with paragraph (15)(B)4. Children’s hospitals and specialty pediatric hospitals will receive fifty percent (50%) of the adjustment calculated in accordance with paragraph (15)(B)4. Safety net hospitals will continue to receive one hundred percent (100%) of the adjustment calculated in accordance with paragraph (15)(B)4. 
C. Effective July 1, 2011, the utilization adjustment will no longer apply to any hospital other than safety net hospitals as defined in subsection (6)(B), children’s hospitals as defined in subsection (2)(S), and specialty pediatric hospitals as defined in subsection (2)(P). Children’s hospitals and specialty pediatric hospitals will con- tinue to receive fifty percent (50%) of the adjustment calculated in accordance with paragraph (15)(B)4. Safety net hospitals will contin- ue to receive one hundred percent (100%) of the adjustment calculat- ed in accordance with paragraph (15)(B)4.; 
5. The poison control cost shall reimburse the hospital for the prorated MO HealthNet managed care cost. It will be calculated by multiplying the estimated MO HealthNet share of the poison control costs by the percentage of managed care participants to total MO HealthNet participants; and 
6. Prior to July 1, 2006, the costs for including out-of-state Medicaid days is calculated by subtracting the hospital’s per diem rate from its trended per diem cost and multiplying this difference by the out-of-state Medicaid days from the base year cost report. Effective July 1, 2006, the costs for including out-of-state Medicaid days is calculated by subtracting the hospital’s per diem rate from its trended per diem cost and multiplying this difference by the out-of- state Medicaid days as determined from the regression analysis per- formed using the out-of-state days from the fourth, fifth, and sixth prior year cost reports.

Title 13—DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES Division 70—MO HealthNet Division Chapter 15—Hospital Program 
EMERGENCY AMENDMENT 13 CSR 70-15.110 Federal Reimbursement Allowance (FRA). 
The division is amending subsection (1)(A) and adding section (22). 
PURPOSE: This amendment provides for the State Fiscal Year (SFY) 2019 trend factor to be applied to the inpatient and outpatient adjust- ed net revenues determined from the Federal Reimbursement Allowance (FRA) fiscal year cost report to determine the inpatient and outpatient adjusted net revenues subject to the FRA assessment. Additionally, this amendment establishes the FRA assessment effec- tive July 1, 2018 at a rate of five and sixty hundredths percent (5.60%) of each hospital’s inpatient and outpatient adjusted net rev- enues. 
EMERGENCY STATEMENT: The Department of Social Services, MO HealthNet Division (MHD) finds that this emergency amendment is necessary to preserve a compelling governmental interest of col- lecting state revenue in order to provide health care to individuals eli- gible for the MO HealthNet program and for the uninsured. An early effective date is required because the emergency amendment is nec- essary to establish the Federal Reimbursement Allowance (FRA) assessment rate effective for dates of service beginning July 1, 2018 in regulation in order to collect the state revenue to ensure access to hospital services for MO HealthNet participants and indigent patients at hospitals that have relied on MO HealthNet payments to meet those patients’ needs. The Missouri Partnership Plan between the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Missouri Department of Social Services (DSS), which establishes a process whereby CMS and DSS determine the permissibility of the funding source used by Missouri to fund its share of the MO HealthNet program, is based on a state fiscal year. In order to deter- mine the trends for State Fiscal Year (SFY) 2019, all relevant infor- mation from the necessary sources must be available to MHD. The division uses the best information available when it starts calculating the assessment so it uses the trend published in the Fourth Quarter Healthcare Cost Review publication which is generally not available until January. The division must also analyze hospital revenue data, which is not complete until near the end of the state fiscal year, in conjunction with the trend and hospital FRA funded payments to determine the appropriate level of assessment. Without this informa- tion, the trends cannot be determined. Therefore, due to timing of the receipt of this information and the necessary July 1, 2018 effective date, an emergency regulation is necessary. The MHD also finds an immediate danger to public health and welfare which requires emer- gency actions. If this emergency amendment is not enacted, hospitals will be over-assessed causing a financial strain on Missouri hospitals which serve approximately nine hundred seventy-one thousand (971,000) MO HealthNet participants plus the uninsured. This finan- cial strain, in turn, will result in an adverse impact on the health, safety, and welfare of MO HealthNet participants and uninsured indi- viduals in need of medical treatment. This emergency amendment will result in an increase of FRA Assessment of approximately $32.5 mil- lion to the hospital industry. A proposed amendment, which covers the same material, will be published in the Missouri Register. This emergency amendment limits its scope to the circumstances creating the emergency and complies with the protections extended by the Missouri and United States Constitutions. The MHD believes this emergency amendment to be fair to all interested persons and parties under the circumstances. The emergency amendment was filed June 
21, 2018, becomes effective July 1, 2018, and expires February 28, 2019. 
(1) Federal Reimbursement Allowance (FRA). FRA shall be assessed as described in this section. 
(A) Definitions. 1. Bad debts—Amounts considered to be uncollectible from 
accounts and notes receivable that were created or acquired in pro- viding services. Allowable bad debts include the costs of caring for patients who have insurance, but their insurance does not cover the particular service procedures or treatment rendered. 
2. Base cost report—Desk-reviewed Medicare/Medicaid cost report. The Medicare/Medicaid Cost Report version 2552-96 (CMS 2552-96) shall be used for fiscal years ending on or after September 30, 1996. The Medicare/Medicaid Cost Report version 2552-10 (CMS 2552-10) shall be used for fiscal years beginning on and after May 1, 2010. When a hospital has more than one (1) cost report with periods ending in the base year, the cost report covering a full twelve- (12-) month period will be used. If none of the cost reports covers a full twelve (12) months, the cost report with the latest period will be used. If a hospital’s base cost report is less than or greater than a twelve- (12-) month period, the data shall be adjusted, based on the number of months reflected in the base cost report, to a twelve- (12-) month period. 
3. Charity care—Those charges written off by a hospital based on the hospital’s policy to provide health care services free of charge or at a reduced charge because of the indigence or medical indigence of the patient. 
4. Contractual allowances—Difference between established rates for covered services and the amount paid by third-party payers under contractual agreements. The Federal Reimbursement Allowance (FRA) is a cost to the hospital, regardless of how the FRA is remitted to the MO HealthNet Division, and shall not be included in contractual allowances for determining revenues. Any redistribu- tions of MO HealthNet payments by private entities acting at the request of participating health care providers shall not be included in contractual allowances or determining revenues or cost of patient care. 
5. Department—Department of Social Services. 6. Director—Director of the Department of Social Services. 7. Division—MO HealthNet Division, Department of Social 
Services. 8. Engaging in the business of providing inpatient health care— 
Accepting payment for inpatient services rendered. 9. Federal Reimbursement Allowance (FRA)—The fee assessed 
to hospitals for the privilege of engaging in the business of providing inpatient health care in Missouri. The FRA is an allowable cost to the hospital. 
10. Fiscal period—Twelve- (12-) month reporting period deter- mined by each hospital. 
11. Gross hospital service charges—Total charges made by the hospital for inpatient and outpatient hospital services that are covered under 13 CSR 70-15.010. 
12. Hospital—A place devoted primarily to the maintenance and operation of facilities for the diagnosis, treatment, or care for not fewer than twenty-four (24) hours in any week of three (3) or more nonrelated individuals suffering from illness, disease, injury, defor- mity, or other abnormal physical conditions; or a place devoted pri- marily to provide, for not fewer than twenty-four (24) hours in any week, medical or nursing care for three (3) or more nonrelated indi- viduals. The term hospital does not include convalescent, nursing, shelter, or boarding homes as defined in Chapter 198, RSMo. 
13. Hospital revenues subject to FRA assessment effective July 1, 2008—Each hospital’s inpatient adjusted net revenues and outpa- tient adjusted net revenues subject to the FRA assessment will be determined as follows: 
A. Obtain “Gross Total Charges” from Worksheet G-2, Line 25, Column 3 from CMS 2552-96, or Worksheet G-2, Line 28,

B. Obtain “Net Revenue” from Worksheet G-3, Line 3, Column 1. The state will ensure this amount is net of bad debts and other uncollectible charges by survey methodology; 
C. “Adjusted Gross Total Charges” (the result of the compu- tations in subparagraph (1)(A)13.A.) will then be further adjusted by a hospital-specific collection-to-charge ratio determined as follows: 
(I) Divide “Net Revenue” by “Gross Total Charges”; and 
(II) “Adjusted Gross Total Charges” will be multiplied by the result of part (1)(A)13.C.(I) to yield “Adjusted Net Revenue”; 
D. Obtain “Gross Inpatient Charges” from Worksheet G-2, Line 25, Column 1 from CMS 2552-96, or Worksheet G-2, Line 28, Column 1 from CMS 2552-10, of the most recent cost report that is available for a hospital;

G. The trend indices listed below will be applied to the appor- tioned inpatient adjusted net revenue and outpatient adjusted net rev- enue in order to inflate or trend forward the adjusted net revenues from the FRA fiscal year cost report to the current state fiscal year to determine the inpatient and outpatient adjusted net revenues sub- 
ject to the FRA assessment. (I) SFY 2009 = 5.50% 
(II) SFY 2009 Missouri Specific Trend = 1.50% (III) SFY 2010 = 3.90% (IV) SFY 2010 Missouri Specific Trend = 1.50% (V) SFY 2011 = 3.20% 
(VI) SFY 2012 = 5.33% (VII) SFY 2013 = 4.4% (VIII) SFY 2014 = 
(a) Inpatient Adjusted Net Revenues—0%

MISSOURI Proposed Rules August 1, 2018 REGISTER Vol. 43, No. 15 

Under this heading will appear the text of proposed rules and changes. The notice of proposed rulemaking is required to contain an explanation of any new rule or any change in an existing rule and the reasons therefor. This is set out in the Purpose section with each rule. Also required is a citation to the legal authority to make rules. This appears fol- lowing the text of the rule, after the word “Authority.” Entirely new rules are printed without any special symbol- 
ogy under the heading of proposed rule. If an existing rule is to be amended or rescinded, it will have a heading of proposed amendment or proposed rescission. Rules which are proposed to be amended will have new matter printed in boldface type and matter to be deleted placed in brackets. An important function of the Missouri Register is to solicit 
and encourage public participation in the rulemaking process. The law provides that for every proposed rule, amendment, or rescission there must be a notice that anyone may comment on the proposed action. This comment may take different forms. If an agency is required by statute to hold a public hearing 
before making any new rules, then a Notice of Public Hearing will appear following the text of the rule. Hearing dates must be at least thirty (30) days after publication of the notice in the Missouri Register. If no hearing is planned or required, the agency must give a Notice to Submit Comments. This allows anyone to file statements in support of or in opposition to the proposed action with the agency within a specified time, no less than thirty (30) days after pub- lication of the notice in the Missouri Register. 
An agency may hold a public hearing on a rule even though not required by law to hold one. If an agency allows comments to be received following the hearing date, the close of comments date will be used as the beginning day in the ninety- (90-) day-count necessary for the filing of the order of rulemaking. 
If an agency decides to hold a public hearing after planning not to, it must withdraw the earlier notice and file a new notice of proposed rulemaking and schedule a hearing for a date not less than thirty (30) days from the date of publication of the new notice. 
Proposed Amendment Text Reminder: Boldface text indicates new matter. [Bracketed text indicates matter being deleted.] 
Title 2—DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Division 90—Weights, Measures and Consumer Protection Chapter 10—Liquefied Petroleum Gases 
PROPOSED RESCISSION 
2 CSR 90-10.016 Meters for Measurement—Specifications and Proving. This rule set out minimum general standards governing the design of meters used for measuring liquefied petroleum gas. 
PURPOSE: This rule should be rescinded because rulemaking authority and powers to promulgate rules is under the Missouri Propane Safety Commission not the Missouri Department of Agriculture. The Missouri Propane Commission voted unanimously to rescind this rule on January 9, 2018, because it duplicates the cur- rent Weights, Measures and Consumer Protection law, which is in Chapter 413 RSMo, Standards of Weights and Measures. 
AUTHORITY: section 323.020, RSMo Supp. 2008. Original rule filed July 13, 1977, effective Nov. 11, 1977. For intervening history, please consult the Code of State Regulations. Rescinded: Filed June 27, 2018. 
PUBLIC COST: The proposed rescission will not cost state agencies or political subdivisions more than five hundred dollars ($500) in the aggregate. 
PRIVATE COST: The proposed rescission will not cost private entities more than five hundred dollars ($500) in the aggregate. 
NOTICE TO SUBMIT COMMENTS: Anyone may file a statement in support of or in opposition to this proposed rescission with Mr. Ronald G. Hayes, Division Director, Weights, Measures and Consumer Protection Division, PO Box 630, Jefferson City, MO 65102 or online at Agriculture.MO.Gov/proposed-rules/. To be con- sidered, comments must be received within thirty (30) days after pub- lication of this notice in the Missouri Register. No public hearing is scheduled.

Title 2—DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Division 90—Weights, Measures and Consumer Protection Chapter 36—Egg Quality Program 
PROPOSED AMENDMENT 
2 CSR 90-36.010 Enforcement of Missouri Egg Laws. The director is amending language in section (1), deleting subsections (1)(B)–(H), relettering remaining subsections, and adding a new reference table to the new subsection (1)(B). 
PURPOSE: The amendment to the rule is to remove unnecessary lan- guage that already referenced in the USDA grading manual. 
(1) [The Department of Agriculture utilizes the following standards, grades and weight classes for inspection of shell eggs.] Shell eggs shall meet the standards as published in the United States Standards, Grades, and Weight Classes for Shell Eggs, AMS 56 (July 20, 2000 or its revision). This document is available on the internet at www.ams.usda.gov/poultry under Publications. 
[(B) Terms Descriptive of Shell. 1. Clean—A shell that is free from foreign material and 
from stains or discolorations that are readily visible. An egg may be considered clean if it has only very small specks, stains, or cage marks, if such specks, stains, or cage marks are not of sufficient number or intensity to detract from the generally clean appearance of the egg. Eggs that show traces of processing oil on the shell are considered clean unless otherwise soiled. 
2. Dirty—A shell that is unbroken and that has dirt or foreign material adhering to its surface, which has prominent stains, or moderate stains covering more than one-thirty sec- ond (1/32) of the shell surface if localized, or one-sixteenth (1/16) of the shell surface if scattered. 
3. Practically Normal (AA or A Quality)—A shell that approximates the usual shape and that is sound and is free from thin spots. Ridges and rough areas that do not materi- ally affect the shape and strength of the shell are permitted. 
4. Abnormal (B Quality)—A shell that may be somewhat unusual or decidedly misshapen or faulty in soundness or strength or that may show pronounced ridges or thin spots. 
(C) Terms Descriptive of the Air Cell. 1. Depth of the air cell (air space between shell mem- 
branes, normally in the large end of the egg)—The depth of the air cell is the distance from its top to its bottom when 

Page 2008 
the egg is held air cell upward. 2. Free air cell—An air cell that moves freely toward the 
uppermost point in the egg as the egg is rotated slowly. 3. Bubbly air cell—A ruptured air cell resulting in one (1) or more small separate air bubbles usually floating beneath 
the main air cell. (D) Terms Descriptive of the White. 
1. Clear—A white that is free from discolorations or from any foreign bodies floating in it. (Prominent Chalzas should not be confused with foreign bodies such as spots or blood clots.) 
2. Firm (AA Quality)—A white that is sufficiently thick or viscous to prevent the yolk outline from being more than slightly defined or indistinctly indicated when the egg is twirled. With respect to a broken-out egg, a firm white has a Haugh unit value of seventy-two degrees Fahrenheit (72°F) or higher when measured at a temperature between forty-five degrees Fahrenheit (45°F) and sixty degrees Fahrenheit (60°F). 
3. Reasonably firm (A Quality)—A white that is some- what less thick or viscous than a firm white. A reasonably firm white permits the yolk to approach the shell more close- ly which results in a fairly well defined yolk outline when the egg is twirled. With respect to a broken-out egg, a reason- ably firm white has a Haugh unit value of sixty degrees Fahrenheit (60°F) up to, but not including, seventy-two degrees Fahrenheit (72°F) when measured at a temperature between forty-five degrees Fahrenheit (45°F) and sixty degrees Fahrenheit (60°F). 
4. Weak and watery (B Quality)—A white that is weak, thin, and generally lacking in viscosity. A weak and watery white permits the yolk to approach the shell closely, thus causing the yolk outline to appear plainly visible and dark when the egg is twirled. With respect to a broken-out egg, a weak and watery white has a Haugh unit value lower than sixty degrees Fahrenheit (60°F) when measured at a tem- perature between forty-five degrees Fahrenheit (45°F) and sixty degrees Fahrenheit (60°F). 
5. Blood spots or meat spots—Small blood spots or meat spots (aggregating not more than one-eighth inch (1/8”) in diameter) may be classified as B Quality. If larger, or showing diffusion of blood into the white surrounding a blood spot, the egg shall be classified as Loss. Blood spots shall not be due to germ development. They may be on the yolk or in the white. Meat spots may be blood spots which have lost their characteristic red color or tissue from the reproductive organs. 
6. Bloody white—An egg which has blood diffused through the white. Eggs with bloody whites are classed as loss. Eggs with blood spots which show a slight diffusion into the white around the localized spot are not to be classed as bloody whites. 
(E) Terms Descriptive of the Yolk. 1. Outline slightly defined (AA Quality)—A yolk outline 
that is indistinctly indicated and appears to blend into the surrounding white as the egg is twirled. 
2. Outline fairly well defined (A Quality)—A yolk outline that is discernible but not clearly outlined as the egg is twirled. 
3. Outline plainly visible (B Quality)—A yolk outline that is clearly visible as a dark shadow when the egg is twirled. 4. Enlarged and flattened (B Quality)—A yolk in which 
the yolk membranes and tissues have weakened and/or moisture has been absorbed from the white to such an extent that the yolk appears definitely enlarged and flat. 
5. Practically free from defects (AA or A Quality)—A yolk that shows no germ development but may show other very slight defects on its surface. 
6. Serious defects (B Quality)—A yolk that shows well developed spots or areas and other serious defects, such as olive yolks, which do not render the egg inedible. 
7. Clearly visible germ development (B Quality)—A development of the germ spot on the yolk of a fertile egg that has progressed to a point where it is plainly visible as a definite circular area or spot with no blood in evidence. 
8. Blood due to germ development—Blood caused by development of the germ in a fertile egg to the point where it is visible as definite lines or as a blood ring. Such an egg is classified as inedible. 
(F) Classifying Eggs by Weight and Grade. 1. Eggs shall be classified by weight into the classes of 
Jumbo, Extra Large, Large, Medium, Small, and Peewee. Egg scales for accurately weighing individual eggs in ounces per dozen shall be a part of the equipment in the egg candling room. 
2. Classes and weights for consumer grades for shell eggs are: 
Proposed Rules 
August 1, 2018 Vol. 43, No. 15 
         
Size or weight class 
Minimum net weight per dozen (ounces) 
Minimum net weight 30 per dozen (pounds) 
    
Jumbo 
     
Large 
24 
3. Interior egg quality specifications for these standards are based on the apparent condition of the interior contents of the egg as it is twirled before the candling light. 
4. Inspectors will determine grades of eggs (AA, A, and B) by candling with a suitable single hole candling light. 
(G) Grades. 1. U.S. Grade AA. 
A. U.S. Consumer Grade AA (at origin) shall consist of eggs which are at least eighty-seven percent (87%) AA Quality. The maximum tolerance of thirteen percent (13%) which may be below AA Quality may consist of A or B Quality in any combination, except that within the tolerance for B Quality not more than one percent (1%) may be B Quality due to air cells over three-eighths inch (3/8”), blood spots (aggregating not more than one-eighth inch (1/8”) in diameter), or serious yolk defects. Not more than five per- cent (5%) (seven percent (7%) for Jumbo size) Checks are permitted and not more than one-half percent (0.50%) Leakers, Dirties, or Loss (due to meat or blood spots) in any combination, except that such Loss may not exceed three- tenths percent (0.30%). Other types of Loss are not permit- ted. 
B. U.S. Consumer Grade AA (destination) shall consist of eggs which are at least seventy-two percent (72%) AA Quality. The remaining tolerance of twenty-eight percent (28%) shall consist of at least ten percent (10%) A Quality and the remainder shall be B Quality, except that within the tolerance for B Quality not more than one percent (1%) may be B Quality due to air cells over three-eighths inch (3/8”), blood spots (aggregating not more than one-eighth inch (1/8”) in diameter), or serious yolk defects. Not more than seven percent (7%) (nine percent (9%) for Jumbo size) Checks are permitted and not more than one percent (1%) Leakers, Dirties, or Loss (due to meat or blood spots) in any combina- tion, except that such Loss may not exceed three-tenths

Missouri Register 
Page 2029 

The division proposes to amend sections (4), (6), and (7); delete sec- tions (1), (3), and (5); and renumber the remaining sections. 
PURPOSE: This amendment serves to reduce unnecessary restrictive language as well as eliminate outdated and redundant requirements. This amendment also renumbers the regulation in light of the amend- ments. 
[(1) All public bodies of Missouri contemplating construction work must obtain from the department an annual wage order which sets forth the prevailing hourly rate of wages in the locality. The rates so determined shall be incorporated in the contract specifications and made a part of those specifica- tions, except that construction contracts of the State Highway and Transportation Commission need not list specif- ic wage rates to apply, but may refer to the wage rates con- tained in the appropriate General Wage Orders issued by the department, as applicable.] 
[(2)](1) Request for annual wage orders shall be initiated at least ten (10) calendar days before advertisement of the specifications for the contract for which the determination is sought. An exception from this provision will be made by the department only upon a proper showing of extenuating circumstances. The department has prepared and printed Form No. PW-3 for use in making a request. The form may be secured by writing Division of Labor Standards, PO Box 449, Jefferson City, MO 65102. 
[(3) A project notification form PW-2 must be filed for each separate project by the public body, except the State Highways and Transportation Commission, which will be fur- nished prevailing wage determinations under General Wage Orders.] 
[(4)](2) The annual wage order issued by the department contains the current wage rates prevailing in the locality at the time the annual wage order is issued. Hours worked during the calendar year are used to set the prevailing wage rates in the annual wage order issued in March of the following year. The department will consider hours sub- mitted for use in its initial determination of the prevailing wage rates to be included in a particular year’s wage order only if those hours are received by it, by either paper submission or in electronic format, no later than January 31 of that year. Section 290.262.9, RSMo, pro- vides that the annual wage order for a particular occupational title may be altered once each year with an incremental increase. A public body shall specify in the call for bids for each contract the prevailing hourly rate of wages in the locality for each type of worker as set forth in the annual wage order or any replacement page(s) identifying the annual incremental increase issued by the department. The wage rates attached to, and made a part of, the call for bids for a contract [shall] will remain in effect for the duration of that particular contract. 
[(5) It should be understood by all interested parties that the certified prevailing wage rates determined by the department are minimum wage rates. The contractor may not pay less than the prevailing wage rates determined by the department for the project or contract awarded to him/her as set forth in the proposal on which s/he submitted his/her bid. Employees are free to bargain for a higher rate of pay and employers are free to pay a higher rate of pay.] 
[(6)](3) [Each month the successful bid contractors shall sub- mit certified copies of their current payrolls to the contract- ing public body.] The public body, upon receipt of the payrolls on a project, shall keep the payrolls on file for a period of one (1) year from the date of submission of the final payrolls by the contractor. The payroll records shall set out accurately and completely the fol- lowing: name and address of each worker, the class or type of worker, 
rate of pay, daily and weekly number of hours worked for each class or type of work performed, deduction made, and actual wages paid for each class or type of work performed by each worker. [The pay- roll records shall be available at all times for inspection by authorized representatives of the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations.] 
[(7)](4) The public body shall make examinations of the payrolls and other records of each contractor or subcontractor as may be neces- sary to assure compliance with the provisions of the law. In connec- tion with those examinations, particular attention should be given to the correctness of classifications and any disproportionate employ- ment of any workers. The examinations shall be of a frequency that may be necessary to assure conformity with the provisions of the law. An examination shall be made after the project has been substantially completed, but prior to, the acceptance of the affidavit as required by section 290.290, RSMo. [If any violation of sections 290.210– 290.580, RSMo, is discovered by the inspecting public body, it is their duty under section 290.250, RSMo, to withhold and retain from payments to the contractor all sums and amounts due and owing as a result of any violation. Any vio- lation shall be immediately reported to the Division of Labor Standards at PO Box 449, Jefferson City, MO 65102 or by telephone.] 
AUTHORITY: section 290.240.2, RSMo [2000] 2016. Original rule filed Dec. 18, 1975, effective Dec. 28, 1975. For intervening history, please consult the Code of State Regulations. Amended: Filed June 19, 2018.

PROPOSED AMENDMENT 8 CSR 30-3.020 Definitions. The division proposes to amend sec- 
tion (2). 
PURPOSE: This amendment serves to eliminate outdated require- ments. 
(2) The term site of the building or construction job means the phys- ical place(s) where the public works are to be constructed, and also means other adjacent or nearby property used by the contractor or subcontractor in that construction which can reasonably be said to be included in the site. Except as otherwise provided in this section, fab- rication plants, mobile factories, batch plants, borrow pits, job head- quarters, tool yards and the like, are part of the site of the building or construction job provided they are dedicated in a substantial degree to the performance of the public works project, and are so located in proximity to the actual construction location that it would be reason- able to include them. [The dedication of seventy-five percent

(75%) or more of the output of a fabrication plant, batch plant and the like, to the public works project raises a rebut- table presumption that the facility is part of the site of the building or construction job.] The presumption may be rebutted by evidence showing that the facility was established for other legitimate commercial purposes that make the facility useful well after the pub- lic works project has been completed. Not included in the site of the building or construction job are permanent home offices, branch plant establishments, fabrication plants, and tool yards of a contractor or subcontractor whose location and continuance in operation are determined wholly without regard to a particular public works pro- ject. In addition, fabrication plants, batch plants, borrow pits, job headquarters, tool yards, and the like, of a commercial supplier or materialman which are established by a supplier of materials for the project before opening of bids and not on the project site are not included in the site of the building or construction job. The perma- nent, previously established facilities are not a part of the site of the building or construction job, even where the operations for a period of time may be dedicated exclusively, or nearly so, to the performance of a public works project. 
AUTHORITY: section 290.240, RSMo [1994] 2016. Original rule filed Aug. 24, 1990, effective April 29, 1991. Amended: Filed July 17, 1995, effective Jan. 30, 1996. Amended: Filed June 19, 2018.

to delete sections (2), (3), and (4). 
PURPOSE: This amendment serves to reduce unnecessary restrictive language as well as eliminate outdated and redundant requirements. 
[(2) Apprentices shall be permitted to work at less than the predetermined rate for the class or type of work they per- formed when they are employed pursuant to and individually registered in a bona fide apprenticeship program registered with the United States Department of Labor, Employment and Training Administration, Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training. The allowable ratio of apprenticeship to journeymen on the site of the construction for any class or type of work- ers shall not be greater than the ratio permitted to the con- tractor as to the entire work force under the registered pro- gram. Any worker listed on the payroll at an apprentice wage rate, who is not registered or otherwise employed as stated in this rule, shall be paid not less than the applicable wage rate on the wage determination for the class or type of work actually performed. In addition, those apprentices perform- 
ing work on the site of the construction who are in excess of the ratio permitted under the registered program shall be paid not less than the applicable wage rate on the wage determination for the class or type of work actually per- formed. Every apprentice shall be paid at not less than the rate specified in the registered program for the apprentice’s level of progress, expressed as a percentage of the journey- men hourly rate for the class or type of worker specified in the applicable wage determination. Apprentices shall be paid fringe benefits in accordance with the provisions of the apprenticeship program. If the apprenticeship program does not specify fringe benefits, apprentices shall be paid the full amount of fringe benefits listed on the wage determination for the applicable class or type of work performed. In the event the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training withdraws approval of an apprenticeship program, the contractor shall no longer be permitted to utilize apprentices at less than the applicable predetermined rate for the class or type of work performed until an acceptable program is approved. 
(3) Trainees will not be permitted to work at less than the predetermined rate for the work performed unless they are employed pursuant to and individually registered in a pro- gram which has received prior approval, evidenced by formal certification by the United States Department of Labor, Employment and Training Administration. The ratio of trainees to journeymen on the job site shall not be greater than permitted under the plan approved by the Employment and Training Administration. Every trainee must be paid at not less than the rate specified in the approved program for the trainee’s level of progress, expressed as a percentage of the journeyman hourly rate specified in the applicable wage determination. Trainees shall be paid fringe benefits in accor- dance with the provisions of the trainee program. If the trainee program does not mention fringe benefits, trainees shall be paid the full amount of fringe benefits listed in the annual wage order for the applicable class or type of work performed. Any employee listed on the payroll at a trainee rate who is not registered and participating in a training plan approved by the Employment and Training Administration shall be paid not less than the applicable wage rate in the annual wage order for the classification of work actually per- formed. In addition, any trainee performing work on the job site in excess of the ratio permitted under the registered pro- gram shall be paid not less than the applicable wage rate on the work actually performed. In the event the Employment and Training Administration withdraws approval of a training program, the contractor will no longer be permitted to utilize trainees at less than the applicable predetermined rate for the work performed until an acceptable program is approved. 
(4) Workers employed on federal-aid highway construction projects may be paid at an apprentice or trainee rate of pay if enrolled in an apprenticeship or skill training program which has been certified by the Secretary of the United States Department of Transportation pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 113. In the event the Secretary of Transportation withdraws approval of a program, the contractor will no longer be per- mitted to pay workers less than the applicable predetermined rate for the work performed until an acceptable program is approved.]

Title 8—DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS Division 30—Division of Labor Standards Chapter 3—Prevailing Wage Law Rules 
PROPOSED AMENDMENT 
8 CSR 30-3.060 Occupational Titles of Work Descriptions. The division proposes to amend the purpose and sections (2), (3), (4), and (6); and subsections (8)(A), (8)(C), (8)(G), (8)(M), and (8)(X). 
PURPOSE: This amendment serves to reduce unnecessary restrictive language in the purpose of the rule, as well as the rule itself. 
PURPOSE: [The Department of Labor and Industrial Relations is required to determine the prevailing hourly rate of wages to be paid to each worker engaged in construction on a pub- lic works project, relative to the type of work performed by each worker.] This rule describes by occupational title the type of work performed in the construction of a public works project in Missouri and sets forth the procedures to be followed in identifying each occupational title utilized on a public works project. 
(2) Each occupational title of work description [shall] will be based upon the particular nature of the work performed, with consideration given to those trades, occupations, or work generally considered within the construction industry as constituting a distinct classifica- tion of work. In determining occupational titles and scope of work definitions, the department [shall] will consider the following: 
(3) Any person wishing to add, delete, or modify an occupational title of work description shall submit to the director of the Division of Labor Standards a written request containing the proposed changes[. Proposals shall contain] and the following information: 
(4) Interested parties who wish to submit wage information to be used in establishing the prevailing hourly rate of wages for a partic- ular class or type of work are required to identify the work according to the applicable occupational title of work description set forth in this rule. Hours of work reported to the department [shall] will not be used to establish the prevailing hourly rate of wages if the party submitting the hours of work fails to identify the work under one (1) of the occupational titles recognized by this rule.

Proposed Rules 
August 1, 2018 Vol. 43, No. 15 
(6) The occupational titles and work descriptions for each type or class of work contained herein are valid throughout the entire state of Missouri. Through an objection to a wage order, an interested party may assert that any given description of work, as stated within this rule, does not apply to a specific occupational title(s) and that a dif- ferent work description should apply to that occupational title(s). The interested party [shall have] has the burden of proving by a pre- ponderance of the evidence the inapplicability of the description of work within that particular occupational title, but [shall] will be afforded the opportunity to do so in a hearing on an objection to the wage order before the Labor and Industrial Relations Commission. 
(8) The occupational titles of work descriptions set forth here are as follows: 
(A) Asbestos Worker/Heat and Frost Insulator—Applies to work- ers who apply insulation materials to mechanical systems to reduce loss or absorption of heat, prevent moisture condensation, and to deaden sound and prevent vibration. The workers remove all insula- tion materials from mechanical systems unless the mechanical system is being scrapped. The work falling within this occupational title of work description includes: 
1. The preparation, including the building of enclosures and hanging polyurethane, and physical distribution on the job site of asbestos, cork, plastic, magnesia or similar materials, or other mate- rials used as a substitute, and used as thermal insulation.

2. The covering, including encapsulation, of boilers, tanks, refrigeration units, evaporators, turbines, fittings, valves, ducts, flues, vats, equipment, hot and cold pipes or any other hot or cold surfaces with the insulation materials listed in this rule, used for the purpose of thermal insulation, fire stoppage, fireproofing, radiator protection, sound deadeners, and the lagging (covering) on piping; and 
3. The removal of all insulation materials from mechanical sys- tems, unless the mechanical system is being scrapped, whether they contain asbestos or not (pipes, boilers, ducts, flues, breechings). All cleanup required in connection with this work, [shall] includes the sealing, labeling, and dropping of scrap material into the appropriate containers. (After drop, final disposal is considered to be the class or type of work falling within the occupational title of work descrip- tion for second semiskilled laborer.); 
(C) Bricklayers and Stone Mason—Applies to workers who pre- pare, lay, set, bed, point, patch, grout, caulk, cut, fit, plumb, align, level, anchor, bolt, or weld brick, stone masonry, precast aggregate panels, and all types of artificial or imitation masonry. Also, the workers install expansion joint materials in brick, stone masonry, precast aggregate panels, and all types of artificial or imitation masonry. The work falling within this occupational title of work description includes: 
1. The unloading of brick, stone masonry, precast aggregate panels, and all types of artificial or imitation masonry where power equipment and rigging are [required] necessary;

Title 8—DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS Division 30—Division of Labor Standards Chapter 5—Prevailing Wage Arbitration 
PROPOSED AMENDMENT 
8 CSR 30-5.020 Hearing Procedures for Arbitration. The division proposes to amend sections (1), (3), and (5); delete sections (6), (7), 
(8), and (11); and renumber the remaining sections. 
PURPOSE: This amendment serves to reduce unnecessary restrictive language as well as eliminate outdated and redundant requirements. This amendment also renumbers the regulation in light of the amend- ments. 
(1) Date, Time, and Site for Arbitration Hearing. All arbitration hearings [shall] will be held in Jefferson City unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. The parties shall respond to requests for hearing dates from the arbitration service provider within ten (10) days of receipt. Upon the request of either party or the arbitration ser- vice provider, the arbitrator [shall have] has the authority to con- vene a scheduling conference call and/or issue a Notice of Hearing setting the date, time, and place for hearing. 
(3) Postponement or Cancellation. The arbitrator, for good cause shown, may postpone or cancel the hearing upon the request of a party or upon his or her own initiative. The parties can also agree to a postponement or cancellation of a hearing. Any postponement or cancellation fees owed to the arbitration service provider and/or the arbitrator shall be paid by the party requesting a postponement or cancellation. If the parties agree to a postponement or cancellation of a hearing, the postponement or cancellation fee shall be divided evenly between the parties. In the event of a cancellation of the arbi- tration after the commencement of the arbitration hearing, all fees owed to the arbitrator for services rendered shall be paid by the party requesting the cancellation. If an employer resolves the matter after requesting arbitration, but prior to an arbitrator’s award, such reso- lution [shall] will be considered a cancellation of the arbitration and the employer shall pay all fees owed to the arbitrator for services ren- dered. 
(5) Commencement of Hearing. A hearing [shall] will be opened by the following actions: 
(A) Administration of the oath to all parties by the arbitrator; and 
(B) Recording of the date, time, and place of the hearing and the presence of the arbitrator, the parties, and counsel, if any. 
[(6) Evidence. (A)The parties may offer such evidence as is relevant and 
material to the dispute and shall produce such additional evi- dence as the arbitrator may deem necessary to reach an understanding and determination of the dispute. An arbitra- tor can subpoena any witnesses and any documents upon the request of any party. If a party, or any person or organiza- tion within the control of a party, fails to obey a subpoena of an arbitrator, the arbitrator shall treat the evidence requested but not produced as establishing an inference favorable to the position of the party who subpoenaed the item, subject to the opposing party’s right to seek an order in Circuit Court quashing or limiting the scope of the subpoena. In the event a party fails to comply with a subpoena, the requesting party may seek to enforce the subpoena in Circuit Court. The arbitrator shall make all decisions regarding the rele- vance and materiality of the evidence offered and conformity to legal rules of any evidence shall not be necessary. All of the evidence shall be taken in the presence of the arbitrator and all the parties except where any of the parties is absent in default or has waived the right to be present. 
(B) All documents that are not filed with the arbitrator before or at the hearing, but arranged at the hearing or sub- sequently by agreement of the parties to be submitted, shall be filed with the arbitration service provider for transmission to the arbitrator or transmitted to the arbitrator directly if the parties agree. All parties shall be able to inspect the docu- ments and object to their relevance and materiality to the dis- pute prior to the arbitrator making a determination of their

relevance and materiality. 
(7) Exhibits. The arbitrator may receive into evidence exhibits offered by the parties. The names and addresses of all wit- nesses and exhibits in order received shall be made part of the record. The arbitrator shall afford each party equal oppor- tunity for the presentation of relevant proofs. Final determina- tions of relevance shall be made by the arbitrator. 
(8) Witnesses. Each party shall provide to the opposing party and the arbitrator a list of witnesses that it intends to call to testify or provide written statements. Such list shall be pro- vided to the opposing party and arbitrator at least two (2) business days prior to the hearing. At the discretion of the arbitrator, failure to do so may result in the party’s forfeiture of its right to call the witness. If a party wants to add per- sons to its witness list within two (2) business days of the hearing or at the hearing, the arbitrator may permit the wit- ness to testify if the arbitrator finds it to be in the interest of fairness and relevant.] 
[(9)](6) Recording and Transcripts. All hearings shall be tape-record- ed. The tape-recording shall be retained by the arbitrator for a period in concurrence with the statute of limitations for an employee to bring a private action for the recovery of wages. Either party may request a written transcript at any time within this period, and the requesting party will bear the cost of the transcript, unless otherwise agreed by the parties. 
[(10)](7) Communication with the Arbitrator. There shall be no direct communication between the parties and the arbitrator on sub- stantive matters relating to the case other than at oral hearings, unless the parties and the arbitrator agree otherwise. Any other oral or writ- ten communication from the parties to the arbitrator shall be directed to the arbitration service provider for transmittal to the arbitrator. 
[(11) Closing the Hearing. The arbitrator shall inquire of all parties whether they have any additional exhibits or witness- es to present. The arbitrator shall afford each party the opportunity to present an oral closing statement. Once both parties indicate that they have no more evidence to present or the arbitrator determines that all necessary relevant and non-duplicative evidence has been presented and the record is complete, the arbitrator shall declare the hearing to be closed. If briefs or other documents are to be filed, the hear- ing shall be declared closed as of the final date set by the arbitrator for filing with the arbitration service provider or directly with the arbitrator. The time limit within which the arbitrator is required to make an award shall begin to run, in the absence of another agreement by the parties, on the closing date of the hearing.]

to amend the purpose and sections (1), (2), (3), and (5). 
PURPOSE: This amendment serves to reduce unnecessary restrictive language in the purpose of the rule, as well as the rule itself. 
PURPOSE: This rule establishes guidelines as to when an arbitra- tor’s award [must] should be rendered and the form in which it [must] should be rendered, the result of a resolution of the contro- versy prior to an arbitrator’s award, the release of arbitration docu- ments for judicial proceedings and a party’s recourse for an arbitra- tor’s failure to follow 8 CSR 30-5.010 through 8 CSR 30-5.030. 
(1) Time of Determination. (B) The determination [shall] will be deemed to be rendered on 
the date it is postmarked or otherwise transmitted to the parties by the arbitrator, whether by regular mail or electronically. Decisions cannot be rendered by telephone. 
(2) Form of the Arbitration Award. The arbitration award shall be in writing and shall be signed by the arbitrator. A party shall advise the arbitrator in writing, by no later than the conclusion of the hearing, whenever it would like the arbitrator to accompany the arbitration award with an opinion explaining the reasoning for the award. All costs incurred as a result of the opinion shall be paid by the party who requested the opinion. If both parties request the opinion, all costs incurred as a result of the opinion [shall] will be divided evenly between the parties. 
(3) Resolution Prior to Arbitrator’s Award. If at any time prior to the arbitrator rendering an award in the matter the employer pays the back wages as determined by the department, the matter [shall] will be deemed resolved and the proceedings [shall] will conclude. All costs shall be paid in accordance with 8 CSR 30-5.020(3) and (4) and sec- tion (2) of this rule. 
(5) Failure to Comply with Determination of Arbitrator. If the employer fails to pay all wages due as determined by the arbitrator within forty-five (45) days following the date the arbitrator’s award is rendered, or if the employer fails to exercise the right to seek arbitra- tion, the department may then pursue an enforcement action to enforce the monetary penalty provisions of 290.250.1, RSMo. If the court orders payment of the penalties as prescribed in 290.250.1, RSMo, the department [shall] will be entitled to recover its actual cost of enforcement from such penalty amount.

This value is the new compliance figure. The VOC per gallon of coating solids for each coating used is then determined using the method referenced in 10 CSR 10-6.030(14)(C) using the one (1)-hour bake. The composite daily volume- weighted average of pounds of VOC per gallon of coating solids as tested for in the actual coatings used is compared to the new compliance figure. Source operations on a coat- ing line using coatings with a composite actual daily volume- weighted average value less than or equal to the new com- pliance figure are in compliance with this regulation. 
(C) As an alternative to the methods specified in subsec- tions (5)(A) and (B), compliance with the emission limits specified in subsections (4)(A) and (B) may be demonstrated by the implementation of an emission reduction equivalency compliance plan which utilizes a daily weighted average of emissions from a single or combination of source operations provided that— 
1. All source operations involved in the plan are subject to the emission limits of this regulation; 
2. All source operations are part of the same installa- tion; 
3. The total actual VOC emissions for each twenty-four (24)-hour period do not exceed the sum of the allowable emissions determined from section (4) for each source oper- ation for the same period; 
4. Equivalent emission reductions are accomplished in the time intervals allowed in subsection (4)(B) as would be required for individual source operations; 
5. After December 24, 1987, testing of raw materials, emissions, equipment, or a combination of these, must be performed prior to initiation of an alternate compliance plan to verify any equivalent emission reductions claimed. All test methods and procedures to be acceptable for use in the equivalency determination must receive prior review and must have been approved by the director. Failure to gain test method and procedure approval of the director will invalidate the equivalency claim; and 
6. The overall plan is approved by the director.] 
[(6)](4) Reporting and Record Keeping. (A) The owner or operator of a coating line shall keep records 
detailing specific VOC sources, as necessary to determine compli- ance. These may include: 
1. The type and the quantity of coatings used daily; 
2. The coating manufacturer’s formulation data for each coating on forms provided or approved by the director; 
3. The type and quantity of solvents for coating, thinning, purg- ing, and equipment cleaning used daily; 
4. All test results to determine capture and control efficiencies, transfer efficiencies, and coating makeup; 
5. The type and quantity of waste solvents reclaimed or discard- ed daily; 
6. The quantity of pieces or materials coated daily; and 
7. Any additional information pertinent to determine compli- ance. 
(B) Records, such as daily production rates, may be substituted for actual daily coating use measurement provided the owner submits a demonstration approvable by the director that these records are ade- quate for the purposes of this regulation. This will apply for all sur- face coating industries until the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issues national daily emissions record keeping proto- cols for specific industrial classifications. 
(C) [Records required under subsections (6)(A) and (B) shall be retained by the owner or operator for a minimum of two (2) years. These records shall be made available to the director upon request.] Owners or operators shall retain records for a minimum of two (2) years and make the records available to the director upon request. 
(5) Test Methods. Use the methods in subsections (5)(A)–(C) as applicable and appropriate to determine compliance with section (3) requirements. 
(A) To calculate the daily volume-weighted emission perfor- mance for automobile and light-duty truck primer-surfacer and topcoat operations for subsection (3)(A), use the procedures in the EPA document, Protocol for Determining the Daily Volatile Organic Compound Emission Rate for Automobile and Light-Duty Truck Topcoat Operations as incorporated by reference in 10 CSR 10-6.030(20). 
(B) For subsection (3)(B)— 1. Compliance with emission limits may be demonstrated 
with EPA Method 24 as specified in 10 CSR 10-6.030(22) using the one (1)-hour bake. Emission performance is based on the daily volume-weighted average of all coatings used in each indus- trial surface coating operation as delivered to the coating appli- cator(s) on a coating line. The daily volume-weighted average (DAVGvw) is calculated by the following formula: 
i=l 
S (Ai × Bi) n 
DAVGVW= ________________ C 
Where: A = daily gal. each coating used (minus water and exempt solvents) in an industrial surface coating 
operation. 
B = lbs. VOC/gal coating (minus water and exempt solvents). 
C = total daily gal. coating used (minus water and exempt solvents) in an industrial surface coating operation. 
n = number of all coating used in an industrial surface coating operation; or 
2. Compliance with the emission limits in subsection (3)(B) may be demonstrated on pounds of VOC per gallon of coating solids basis. The demonstration is made by first converting the emission limit in subsection (3)(B) to pounds of VOC per gallon of coating solids as shown in the following three (3) steps: 
lbs. VOC per gallon of coating minus water 
1) & exempt solvents 7.36 lbs. per gallon 
2) 1 – Volume fraction of VOC 
lbs. VOC per gallon of coating minus water 
3) & exempt solvents

This value is the new compliance figure. The VOC per gallon of coating solids for each coating used is then determined with EPA Method 24 as specified in 10 CSR 10-6.030(22) using the one (1)- hour bake. The composite daily volume-weighted average of pounds of VOC per gallon of coating solids as tested for the actual

coatings used is compared to the new compliance figure. Source operations on a coating line using coatings with a composite actu- al daily volume-weighted average value less than or equal to the new compliance figure are in compliance with this regulation. 
(C) As an alternative to the methods specified in subsections (5)(A) and (B), compliance with the emission limits specified in subsections (3)(A) and (B) may be demonstrated by the imple- mentation of an emission reduction equivalency compliance plan, which utilizes a daily weighted average of emissions from a single or combination of source operations provided that— 
1. All source operations involved in the plan are subject to the emission limits of this regulation; 
2. All source operations are part of the same installation; 
3. The total actual VOC emissions for each twenty-four (24)- hour period do not exceed the sum of the allowable emissions determined from section (3) for each source operation for the same period; 
4. Equivalent emission reductions are accomplished in the time intervals allowed in subsection (5)(B); 
5. After December 24, 1987, testing of raw materials, emis- sions, equipment, or a combination of these, shall be performed prior to initiation of an alternate compliance plan to verify any equivalent emission reductions claimed. Director approval prior to review is necessary for all test methods and procedures to be acceptable for use in the equivalency determination. Failure to gain test method and procedure approval of the director will invalidate the equivalency claim; and 
6. The overall plan is approved by the director.

PROPOSED AMENDMENT 
10 CSR 10-5.220 Control of Emissions During Petroleum Liquid Storage, Loading, and Transfer. The commission proposes to amend the rule title, sections (1)–(3) and (5), and subsection (4)(B); amending and renumbering subsection (4)(D); and deleting subsec- tion (4)(C). If the commission adopts this rule action, the department 
intends to submit this rule amendment to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to replace the current rule that is in the Missouri State Implementation Plan. The evidence supporting the need for this proposed rulemaking is available for viewing at the Missouri Department of Natural Resources’ Air Pollution Control Program at the address listed in the Notice of Public Hearing at the end of this rule. More information concerning this rulemaking can be found at the Missouri Department of Natural Resources’ Proposed Rules web- site www.dnr.mo.gov/proposed-rules. 
PURPOSE: This amendment removes obsolete provisions, reduces the regulatory burden on facilities, improves consistency with the Kansas City rule 10 CSR 10-2.260 that regulates the same types of facilities, eliminates the permitting requirement for Stage I vapor recovery systems, and clarifies rule language on testing, reporting, and other items. This amendment also complies with Executive Order 17-03 criteria and removes any unnecessary restrictive words, adds back definitions specific to the rule, and adds incorporations by ref- erence as applicable. The evidence supporting the need for this pro- posed rulemaking, per 536.016, RSMo, is Executive Order 17-03 Red Tape Reduction Review and related comments. 
PURPOSE: This rule restricts volatile organic compound emissions from the handling of petroleum liquids in five specific areas: petrole- um storage tanks with a capacity greater than forty thousand gallons, the loading of gasoline into delivery vessels, the transfer of gasoline from delivery vessels into storage containers, gasoline delivery ves- sels and the fueling of motor vehicles from storage containers. This rule is [required] necessary to achieve the federally mandated reduction of hydrocarbon emissions in the St. Louis metropolitan area that contribute to the formation of ozone.

Title 10—DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES Division 10—Air Conservation Commission Chapter 5—Air Quality Standards and Air Pollution Control Rules Specific to the St. Louis Metropolitan Area 
PROPOSED AMENDMENT 
10 CSR 10-5.330 Control of Emissions From Industrial Surface Coating Operations. The commission proposes to amend sections (1), (2), and (5); and amend subsections (3)(A) through (3)(E), (3)(G) through (3)(K), (4)(A), and (4)(D). If the commission adopts this rule action, the department intends to submit this rule amend- ment to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to replace the current rule that is in the Missouri State Implementation Plan. The evidence supporting the need for this proposed rulemaking is avail- able for viewing at the Missouri Department of Natural Resources’ Air Pollution Control Program at the address listed in the Notice of Public Hearing at the end of this rule. More information concerning this rulemaking can be found at the Missouri Department of Natural Resources’ Proposed Rules website www.dnr.mo.gov/proposed- rules. 
PURPOSE: This rule restricts the emissions of volatile organic com- pounds from industrial surface coating operations. This amendment creates a new surface coating category for the decorative coating of foam products and establishes an appropriate RACT-level emission limit for this type of surface coating operation. This amendment also removes obsolete provisions that were applicable prior to March 1, 2012, removes a reference to a rule that is being rescinded since it is duplicative of a federal rule, removes unnecessary language and use of restrictive words, adds definitions specific to this rule, changes rule language to be consistent with defined terms, and updates incor- porations by reference. The evidence supporting the need for this pro- posed rulemaking, per 536.016, RSMo, is a rule comment form dated March 26, 2014, describing how the surface coating of foam products has been miscategorized under the surface coating of rubber prod- 
ucts, and requesting changes to certain terms for consistency, and Executive Order 17-03 Red Tape Reduction Review and related com- ments. 
(1) Applicability. (A) This rule [shall apply] applies throughout St. Louis City and 
Jefferson, St. Charles, Franklin, and St. Louis Counties. (B) This rule [shall apply] applies to any [installation] facility with actual emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from industrial surface coating operations, including related cleaning activities, of at least three (3) tons per twelve (12)-month rolling 
period, before consideration of controls. 
[(C) This rule is only applicable to the surface coating of manufactured items intended for distribution in commerce to persons other than the person or legal entity performing the surface coating.] 
[(D)](C) Exemptions. This rule is not applicable to the following: 1. Motor vehicle refinishing; 2. Customizing top coating of motor vehicles, if production is 
less than thirty-five (35) vehicles per day; 3. Surface coating that is part of janitorial, building, and 
[installation] facility maintenance operations; 4. Research and development, performance testing, and quality

The permit- tee shall also provide information identifying any applicable requirements which became applicable subsequent to issuance of the operating permit. Within thirty (30) days after the applicant’s request for validation, the permitting authority will take action denying or approving validation of the issued operating permit, or its amendment. If the permit- tee demonstrates compliance with both the construction and operating permits, or its amendment, the permitting authority shall validate the operating permit, or its amend- ment, and forward it to the permittee. No part 70 permit will be validated unless— 
1. At the time of validation, the permitting authority cer- tifies that the issued permit contains all applicable require- ments; or 
2. The procedures for permit renewal in 10 CSR 10- 6.065(6)(E)3. have occurred prior to validation to insure the inclusion of any new applicable requirements to which the part 70 permit is subject.]

tion, or modification. (D) Ambient air increments—The limited increases of pollu- 
tant concentrations in ambient air over the baseline concentra- tion. 
(E) Emission(s)—The release or discharge, whether directly or indirectly, into the atmosphere of one (1) or more air contami- nants listed in subsection (3)(A) of 10 CSR 10-6.020. 
(F) Good engineering practice (GEP) stack height—The greater of— 
1. Sixty-five meters (65 m) measured from the ground-level elevation at the base of the stack; 
2. For stacks on which construction commenced on or before January 12, 1979, and for which the owner or operator had obtained all applicable permits or approvals required under 40 CFR 51 and 52, 
Hg = 2.5H 
provided the owner or operator produces evidence that this equa- tion was actually relied on in establishing an emission limitation; and for all other stacks, 
Hg = H + 1.5L 
Where: Hg = GEP stack height, measured from the ground-level eleva- tion at the base of the stack; H = height of nearby structure(s) measured from the ground- level elevation at the base of the stack; and L = lesser dimension, height, or projected width of the nearby structure(s). Provided that the director may require the use of a field study or fluid model to verify GEP stack height for the installation; or 
3. The height demonstrated by a fluid model or field study approved by the director, which ensures that the emissions from a stack do not result in excessive concentrations of any air pollu- tant as a result of atmospheric downwash, wakes, or eddy effects created by the source itself, nearby structures, or nearby terrain features. 
(G) Incinerator—Any article, machine, equipment, con- trivance, structure, or part of a structure used to burn refuse or to process refuse material by burning other than by open burn- ing. 
(H) Modification—Any physical change to, or change in method of operation of, a source operation or attendant air pol- lution control equipment which would cause an increase in poten- tial emissions of any air pollutant emitted by the source opera- tion. 
(I) Nonattainment pollutant—Each and every pollutant for which the location of the source is in an area designated to be in nonattainment of a National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) under section 107(d)(1)(A)(i) of the Act. Any con- stituent or precursor of a nonattainment pollutant shall be a nonattainment pollutant, provided that the constituent or pre- cursor pollutant may only be regulated under this rule as part of regulation of the corresponding NAAQS pollutant. Both volatile organic compounds (VOC) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) shall be nonattainment pollutants for a source located in an area desig- nated nonattainment for ozone. 
(J) Offset—A decrease in actual emissions from a source oper- ation or installation that is greater than the amount of emissions anticipated from a modification or construction of a source oper- ation or installation. The decrease must have substantially simi- 
lar environmental and health effects on the impacted area. Any ratio of decrease to increase greater than one-to-one (1:1) consti- tutes offset. The exceptions to this are ozone nonattainment areas where volatile organic compound and oxides of nitrogen emis- sions will require an offset ratio of actual emission reduction to new emissions according to the following schedule: 
1. marginal area = 1.1:1; 2. moderate area = 1.15:1; 3. serious area = 1.2:1; 4. severe area = 1.3:1; and 5. extreme area = 1.5:1.

(P) Regulated air pollutant—All air pollutants or precursors for which any standard has been promulgated. 
(Q) Risk assessment levels (RALs)—Ambient concentrations of air toxics that are not expected to produce adverse cancer and non-cancer health effects during a defined period of exposure. The RALs are based upon animal toxicity studies, human clinical studies, and human epidemiology studies that account for expo- sure to sensitive populations such as the elderly, pregnant women, children, and those having respiratory illness such as asthma. 
(R) Screening model Action Levels (SMALs)—The emission threshold of an individual hazardous air pollutant (HAP) or HAP group that triggers the need for an air quality analysis of the individual HAP. 
(S) Shutdown—The cessation of operation of any air pollution control equipment or process equipment. 
(T) Shutdown, permanent—See permanent shutdown. 
(U) Start-up—The setting into operation of any air pollution control equipment or process equipment, except the routine phasing in of process equipment.

Title 10—DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES Division 23—[Division of Geology and Land Survey] Well Installation Chapter 3—Water Well Construction Code 
PROPOSED AMENDMENT 
10 CSR 23-3.080 Liners. The board is amending the division name, chapter name, rule purpose, sections (1)–(5), adding Table 3.8 and 3.9, and removing Table 5 and Table 6. 
PURPOSE: This amendment clarifies the three (3) types of situations where a liner may be used and provides a clear method for each sce- nario. 
PURPOSE: This rule sets guidelines for the use of liners in water wells [in Missouri]. 
[(1) Use of Liners. Liners are generally used for three (3) pur- poses. They are used to— 
(A) Hold the well bore open when caving or spalling rock is encountered. These liners are usually slotted to allow water to enter the well from the aquifer; or 
(B) Seal out problem areas below the existing casing or to correct inadequate grouting seals of the casing annulus and other problems arising concerning contamination of subsur- face waters. Plastic liners may be used effectively to solve iron bacteria problems on steel casings. If a plastic liner is installed to seal out an iron bacteria problem, it must extend from the bottom of the steel casing and must have its upper end no deeper than ten feet (10’) below the top of the well casing. The liner must also be grouted as stated in subsec- tion (3)(B) of this rule; or 
(C) If the liner is just used to solve a rust problem in the casing, a packer must be placed within five feet (5’) of the bottom of the rusted casing interval. The liner must extend from the bottom of the steel casing to a point less than 10 feet (10’) from the surface. The packer must be inside the casing and no grout is required. 
(2) General Specifications and Guidelines. (A) Liners may be composed of either steel or thermoplas- 
tic. 
1. Steel liners must be new and have an inside diameter at least four inches (4”) and have a minimum wall thickness not less than .188 inches. 
2. Plastic liners must meet American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards concerning thermoplastic well casing and be composed of polyvinyl (PVC) or acryloni- trile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) materials formulated for well casing. 
A. The inside diameter must not be smaller than four inches (4”). 
B. The Standard Dimension Ratio (SDR) ratings allow- able for liner is SDR 26, SDR 21, SDR 17 and SDR 13.5. Schedule ratings allowable are SCH 40 and SCH 80. 
(B) All liners used to seal out potential groundwater contamination areas below the existing casing or to correct inadequate grouting seals of the casing annulus, and other problems arising concerning the contamination of subsur- face water must have their upper end set no deeper than ten

Proposed Rules 
August 1, 2018 Vol. 43, No. 15 
feet (10’) below the top of the well casing. The liner must be secured in the hole. 
(C) Packers shall be secured on plastic liners with screws (making sure they do not penetrate the liner) or other meth- ods and on steel liners the packer shall be welded or mechanically attached so that it will not move during liner placement. Packers are not required on liners used only to hold open the well bore. 
(D) Whenever a liner is needed it is recommended that the bottom of the liner be at the bottom of the well. This will help prevent potential future problems with pump replace- ment. 
(3) Method of Installation. (A) When liners are used only to hold open the well bore 
they may be placed in the well following normal industry installation procedures. 
(B) All other liners must be sealed into place following these procedures: 
1. The liner must have a rubber packer (first packer) secured near the bottom of the interval to be grouted. Another rubber packer (the second packer) must be secured about twenty feet (20’) above the first packer. This will result in two (2) rubber packers spaced about twenty feet (20’) apart on the liner. These packers must hold the grout in place. Grout must be placed between the first and second packer and completely fill this interval as the liner is being installed into the casing. Grout must also be placed on top of the second packer filling it to at least a point twenty feet (20’) above the third packer. Care must be taken by the well installation contractor when selecting the type of grout used, keeping in mind the time of liner installation and grout set-up time. The liner shall be placed into the well casing being careful not to damage the packers or liner, or two (2) packers must be placed close together near the bottom of the liner and grouted after the liner is set by pressure grout- ing through a tremie pipe. The bottom sixty feet (60’) of annulus created when installing a four and one-half-inch (4 1/2”) or five-inch (5”) outside diameter liner must be grout- ed. If a liner must be grouted, a minimum annulus of one- half inch (1/2”) must be present. Tables 5 and 6 state the required amount of grout to fill the annulus sixty feet (60’); or 
2. Alternate grouting procedures will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Written approval in advance by the division is required. 
(4) Permittee Responsibility to Seal Liner. In wells that have a liner used for any purpose, other than holding the well bore open, it is the responsibility of the permittee to ensure that the annulus between the well bore and the liner is sealed. 
(5) PVC and ABS liners may never be used when known gasoline or solvent contamination exists within one hundred (100) yards of the well being repaired or drilled. When gaso- line or solvent contamination levels do not present a poten- tial threat to the integrity of the pipe or liner, the use of PVC or ABS pipe material will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Approval must be received in advance.

Title 10—DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES Division 23—[Division of Geology and Land Survey] Well Installation Chapter 3—Water Well Construction Code 
PROPOSED AMENDMENT 
10 CSR 23-3.110 Plugging of Water Wells. The board is amending the division name, chapter name, rule purpose, sections (1)–(5) and removing sections (6) and (7). The board is also removing Figures 9 through 11. 
PURPOSE: This amendment clarifies how to plug a well based on well type. 
PURPOSE: This rule establishes [criteria for the proper plugging procedures to be followed when abandoning] standards for plugging a water well. [Plugging procedures for monitoring wells are contained in 10 CSR 23-4.080, for heat pump wells in 10 CSR 23-5.080 and for test holes in 10 CSR 23- 6.050.] 
[Editor’s Note: This rule was originally filed as part of 10 CSR 23-3.020 General Protection of Groundwater. It is pro- posed as a separate rule because of added emphasis given 
to abandonment procedures in the amendment to the law. 
(1) Any well which is to be abandoned must be plugged in accordance with these rules. If a well has been determined to present a threat to groundwater, the division may order that the well be permanently plugged. If a well is in such a state of disrepair (such as the pump has been removed or the water line disconnected) that continued use for purposes of obtaining groundwater is impractical and the well has not been in use for a period of two (2) years or more, the divi- sion may order that the well be permanently plugged. 
(2) Permanent Abandonment of Wells. (A) Plugging the Well. 
1. A well that is to be permanently abandoned shall be disconnected from the water distribution system and the hole filled to prevent contaminating materials from entering the subsurface water-bearing formations and groundwater from one (1) aquifer mixing with that of another aquifer. Bentonite or cement grout shall be used for grouting mater- ial. If the well is so large that the use of these materials is not practical, the division will determine a proper plugging schedule. All materials, debris and obstructions that may interfere with plugging operations shall be removed from the well. Liner pipe shall be removed or perforated when neces- sary to assure placement of an effective plug. 
2. The division must be consulted for instruction in case of abandonment of a contaminated well or where there is a question of proper procedure. Sampling of the fluids in the well may be required. A permitted well installation or pump installation contractor must be utilized to plug the well. 
(B) An abandoned well shall be plugged by one (1) of the following methods in this section in accordance with the materials penetrated, in such a manner as to prevent it from acting as a channel for pollution. A report of the method of plugging shall be filed with the division on a registration report form that is provided by the division. 
(C) Plugging requirements contained in 10 CSR 23- 3.010—10 CSR 23-3.100 do not pertain to bedrock irrigation wells and public water supply wells which include commu- nity, noncommunity and nontransient noncommunity type wells. Plugging requirements for these types of wells will be determined on a case-by-case basis by the division and must be performed by a permitted contractor, and may be more stringent than those for domestic and multifamily wells. 
1. Hand dug wells and bored wells no deeper than eighty feet (80’). To plug this type of well, the following steps must be followed (see Figure 9): 
A. Remove all pumps, pipe, debris and surface cover- ings or concrete cap; 
B. Push in top three feet (3’) of well lining. Lining may be composed of rock, brick or tile. If lining is composed of any other material consult the division for further instruc- tions; 
C. Fill well to within three feet (3’) from the surface with clean fill such as gravel, sand, varied sized agricultural lime or other approved material; 
D. Disinfect fill material. If there is water in the well, chlorine must be added to bring its concentration to at least one hundred (100) parts per million (ppm) (see Table 1 in 10 CSR 23-3.050). As the fill material is poured into the well, it is disinfected as it comes in contact with the chlorinated water. If there is no water in the well to be plugged, disinfect the fill material before it is placed into the well; 
E. Fill the remaining hole with clay or clay-rich soil. Soil should be mounded slightly at the top to help offset set- tling; and 
F. Submit the registration report form and fee to the

division. 2. Wells completed in unconsolidated deposits. This 
type of well includes alluvial wells, glacial drift wells and nonbedrock wells. To plug this type of well, the following steps must be followed: 
A. Remove all pumps, pipe and debris from well; 
B. Dig around casing and remove top three feet (3’) of casing. The remaining hole must be at least two feet (2’) in diameter larger than the existing casing (see Figure 10); 
C. Fill well from total depth to fifty feet (50’) from surface with clean fill such as gravel, sand, varied sized agri- cultural lime or other approved material; 
D. Disinfect fill material. If there is water in the well, you must add chlorine to the water bringing it to a concen- tration of at least one hundred (100 ppm) (see Table 1 in 10 CSR 23-3.050). As the fill material is poured into the well, it is disinfected as it comes in contact with the chlorinated water. If there is no water in the well to be plugged, disinfect the fill material before it is placed into the well; 
E. Place a grout plug that fills the upper fifty feet (50’) of casing and extends into the larger excavated area, at least one foot (1’). In agricultural or yard settings the remaining hole above the grout plug must be filled with soil. In other settings, the remaining hole above the grout plug may be filled with clean fill if the well site is to be paved; and 
F. Submit registration report form and fee to the divi- sion. 
3. Wells completed in bedrock. This type of well includes any domestic well that produces water from bedrock aquifers (see Figure 11). To plug this type of well, the following steps must be followed: 
A. Remove all pumps, pipe and debris from well. Any liner must be removed or perforated if possible; 
B. Dig around casing and remove top three feet (3’) of casing. The remaining hole must be at least two feet (2’) in diameter larger than the existing casing; 
C. Fill well from total depth to fifty feet (50’) below bottom of casing with clean fill such as gravel, sand, varied sized agricultural lime or other approved fill material; 
D. Disinfect fill material. If there is water in the well, you must add chlorine to the water bringing it to a concen- tration of at least one hundred (100) ppm (see Table 1 in 10 CSR 23-3.050). As the fill material is poured into the well, it is disinfected as it comes in contact with the chlorinated water. If there is no water in the well to be plugged, disinfect any fill material used before it is placed into the well; 
E. Place cement or bentonite from a point fifty feet (50’) below the bottom of the casing to two feet (2’) from the surface making sure the grout extends into the excavat- ed area at least one foot (1’). If the water level is above a point fifty feet (50’) below the bottom of the casing, then bentonite chips must be used or the cement or bentonite slurry must be emplaced through a tremie pipe lowered through the water level to the top of the fill. Under no cir- cumstances may cement or bentonite slurry be poured through large columns of water without the use of a tremie pipe (see paragraph (2)(C)6. for alternative cement plugging technique); 
F. May plug the well, if the well has one hundred fifty feet (150’) or more of casing, by filling the well with clean aggregate to a point fifty feet (50’) below the bottom of the casing, placing a grout plug from this point extending up into the casing thirty feet (30’). From this point to within fifty feet (50’) of the surface, clean aggregate fill may be used. From fifty feet (50’) to two feet (2’) must be filled with grout making sure the grout extends into the excavated area at least one foot (1’); 
G. Cut casing off at top of bedrock, if bedrock is 
encountered when digging around the casing, and fill remaining hole with cement slurry. In agricultural or yard set- tings, the plug must terminate at least two feet (2’) below the finished surface grade and the remaining hole filled with soil. In other settings, the remaining hole may be filled with clean fill if the well site is to be paved; and 
H. Submit registration report form and fee to division. 4. For those wells which casing depth, water level and total depth are not known and cannot be determined, plug- ging instructions will be determined on a case-by-case basis 
and may be more stringent. 5. As clean fill is being placed into a well, periodic 
measurements should be taken to ensure that the fill does not reach a point closer than fifty feet (50’) below the bot- tom of the existing casing. If fill is placed above this point, plugging schedules will be determined by the division and may result in removal of fill material. 
6. When plugging a well that contains water that is above a point of fifty feet (50’) below the bottom of the cas- ing or liner, whichever is deeper, cement slurry may be poured into the well if a tremie pipe is placed in the well to near the bottom and acts as a conduit for the water to escape through as the cement slurry is poured into the well casing from the surface. The cement slurry must be poured in one (1) continuous operation. Mixing small batches and pouring is not permitted. 
7. The flow in a flowing well shall be confined, if possi- ble, and the well plugged in accordance with well plugging requirements supplied by the division which will be deter- mined on a case-by-case basis. Proper judgment shall be exercised in the feasibility of plugging flowing wells. In some cases the confining formation may have been so badly dis- turbed that plugging may only cause the flow to discharge in a less appropriate location. In other situations, the flow may have eroded so much material that the landscape has taken on the appearance of a natural spring. The plugging in this case may be impractical, if not impossible. 
(3) Owners Responsibility for Plugging Well. The owner shall be responsible for the permanent plugging of an abandoned well except when the permittee improperly locates, con- structs or completes the well. The permittee shall then be responsible for the plugging of the well. 
(4) Wells Abandoned by Landowners. Wells abandoned by landowners after August 28, 1991, shall be plugged or cause to be plugged, in accordance with this rule. Landowners may plug their own wells located on property they own or lease, if the wells were intended for use only in single-family houses which are their permanent residences, or were intended for use only for farming purposes on their farms, and where the waters that were produced were not intended for use by the public or in any residence other than their own. If a landowner pays someone to assist with the plugging of the well, that person must hold a current Missouri well installation contractor permit or Missouri pump installation contractor permit except as stated in 10 CSR 23- 1.090(2) concerning hand dug wells. If the division makes a finding that certain unusual conditions exist at a well that is to be plugged, the division may require that the well be plugged by a permitted well installation contractor or a per- mitted pump installation contractor. Unusual conditions exist at a well that is to be plugged if the total depth, amount of casing and water level are not known; a liner is in the well; foreign objects are stuck in the well; the well is contaminat- ed with pollutants other than bacteria; or other conditions determined by the division on a case-by-case basis.

Proposed Rules 
August 1, 2018 Vol. 43, No. 15 
(5) A permittee or landowner who permanently abandons any well that is removed from service shall report the aban- donment to the division on a registration report form provid- ed by the division. A permittee or landowner shall report to the division any unplugged abandoned wells existing on his/her property (landowner) or property on which a permit- tee is hired to perform well drilling repair or pump installa- tion. 
(6) All wells may be plugged by filling the well via tremie or pressure grouting with cement slurry, bentonite or bentonite slurry from total depth to two feet (2’) from the surface, if this method exceeds other minimum standards. 
(7) If the division finds that certain conditions for high potential of groundwater contamination exist at a well, the division may require that a permitted well installation con- tractor or pump installation contractor be contracted to plug the well.] 
(1) General Plugging Requirements for Water Wells. (A) Abandoned wells shall be plugged in accordance with these rules pursuant to sections 256.603(1) and 256.615, RSMo. If a well presents a contamination threat to groundwater, the depart-

2. When using an industry standard size eight and one- quarter-inch (8 1/4”) internal diameter hollow stem auger to drill the unconsolidated material portion of the well, the bedrock portion of the well must be drilled with a bit which creates a hole that is at least eight inches (8”) in diameter for a well constructed using a nominal four-inch (4”) diame- ter riser pipe.] 
(4) Open-[H]hole [C]completions[. Open-hole completed moni- toring wells are allowed only upon written approval in advance from the division. In all cases, the open-hole portion of the well must] may be allowed upon advanced written approval by the department. If approved, the open-hole portion shall be in competent, consolidated bedrock, [and] with the casing [must] extending from the surface to the minimum total depth and minimum depth into bedrock [required, under] pursuant to 10 CSR 23-3.090 [or 10 CSR 23-3.100] for a domestic well at that location.

Extend [T]the riser pipe [must extend] from the well screen into the surface completion. [In a flood prone area, the riser pipe must be at least two feet (2’) above the finished surface grade and be equipped with a watertight cap. Wells installed in traffic ways may be flush mounted (subsection (11)(B)). Unless they are direct-push wells or wells con- structed through hollow stem augers, monitoring wells in excess of fifty feet (50’) in depth must have centralizers to ensure the well string is properly plumbed. A centralizer must be placed at the base of the well screen and on the riser at the top of the filter pack. The specific placement intervals for additional centralizers on the riser should be based on site-specific conditions and ensure the placement of the filter pack, bentonite seal, and annular seal will not be hindered. The use of centralizers in wells constructed through hollow stem augers is not required.] Monitoring wells greater than fifty feet (>50') in depth shall have centralizers installed at the base of the well screen and at the top of the filter pack. A centralizer is not necessary for direct-push wells or wells constructed through hollow-stem augers.

(6) [Installation of] Primary Filter Pack. [After the well screen and riser assembly are installed in the well, the filter pack materials must be emplaced.] All monitoring wells shall have a primary filter pack installed using one (1) of the following meth- ods. Other methods may be used upon advanced written approval by the department. 
(A) Artificially Constructed Filter Pack Placement. Place [T]the filter pack material [must be placed] evenly around the well screen via a tremie pipe. The tremie pipe must be placed [near the] within five feet (5') of the bottom of the well screen and the filter pack material poured into the tremie pipe while the pipe is slowly removed. [A weighted measuring device must be used to ensure that the filter pack is properly installed to the desired depth. All volumes of filter pack material anticipated for con- struction must be calculated prior to placement.] Fill [T]the borehole with filter pack material [must fill from the bottom of the borehole] to within one to five feet (1'–5') above the well screen. If the well is drilled [utilizing] using the hollow stem auger method, the filter pack material may be poured through the hollow stem auger as it is removed from the borehole. [If the screen is set more than twenty-five feet (25’) into the saturated zone or placed into drilling fluid other than clean water or air, the fil- ter pack placement must be via tremie, unless hollow stem augers are used.] Prepacked filter pack assemblies [and prepack seals which are hydrated may be used] may be used in lieu of artificially constructed filter pack placement. 
(B) Naturally Developed Filter Pack Placement. [Allowing t]The existing geologic material may be allowed to collapse around the well screen [is an acceptable method of filter pack emplace- ment in only a few geologic conditions. Naturally developed filter packs are only allowable when they can be developed properly] provided the well can be developed. 
(C) [When installing a monitoring well for shallow monitor- ing, the primary filter pack must] The primary filter pack on shallow monitoring wells shall extend a minimum of six inches (6") above the top of the well screen. 
(D) Soil vapor implants [are required to] shall have a minimum primary filter pack of six inches (6") above and below each implant. 
(7) [The installation of a] Secondary Filter Pack. All monitoring wells shall have a secondary filter pack [is required] unless non- slurry bentonite is used as a bentonite seal or annular seal. [The purpose of a secondary filter pack, which is placed directly on top of the primary filter pack, is to ensure that annular seal slurry grouts do not infiltrate into the primary filter pack.] The secondary filter pack [must] shall extend from one foot to two feet (1'–2') above the primary filter pack and [shall] consist of one foot to two feet (1'–2') of clean fine sand. 
(8) [The installation of a b]Bentonite [s]Seal. A bentonite seal of two feet (2') or greater is required if the annular seal is composed of slurry grout material and a secondary filter pack is not used. [The purpose of the bentonite seal is to keep the slurry grout which is emplaced above from mixing with the primary and secondary filter pack materials. If required, the bentonite seal must be a minimum of two feet (2’) thick.] 
(A) Placement of the Bentonite Seal in the Saturated Zone. When the bentonite seal is to be emplaced in the saturated zone, only [chipped or pelletized bentonite that is designed to fall through standing water before it hydrates] bentonite chips or pellets may be used. To avoid flash swelling and bridging, the fine bentonite material, which may develop during transport, [must] shall not be introduced into the well bore. [A weighted measuring device must be utilized to ensure] Place the bentonite chips [are] evenly [placed] around the riser pipe. 
(B) Placement of the Bentonite Seal in the Unsaturated Zone. When the top of the secondary filter pack is in the unsaturated zone, [the use of chipped, pelletized, or granular] bentonite [is per- 
mitted only if] chips, pellets, or granules may be used provided the bentonite is hydrated in place with potable water. Bentonite slurry may be used [and must] to fill the annular space from the top of the secondary filter pack, if present, to the surface seal via a tremie pipe. [The bentonite slurry must be emplaced through a tremie pipe.] If the total depth of the slurry being placed exceeds five feet (5'), use a side discharge [is required so as] to limit dis- ruption of the filter packs. 
[(C) Nested well construction will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Pre-approval by the division is required, via the variance process, before construction begins, except that gas-migration wells constructed using soil vapor implants do not require a variance as long as they meet, the requirements of subsection (6)(D) of this rule, have a mini- mum bentonite seal of one foot (1’) between each primary filter pack, and a minimum of one and one-half feet (1.5’) of bentonite seal between the uppermost primary filter pack and that base of the surface completion.] 
(9) Installation of the Annular Seal. [The monitoring well envi- ronment may contain many chemicals or organic compounds that could affect the sealing capabilities of various kinds of grout. The type of grout used must be able to function to one hundred percent (100%) of its designed sealing capabil- ities until the well is properly plugged. The type of grout used must not influence, contaminate, or hinder the use of the monitoring well for its designed purpose.] The annular seal must extend from the secondary filter pack or bentonite seal to the base of the surface completion. The combined annular seal and ben- tonite seal (if a bentonite seal is utilized) must be at least two feet (2') thick unless monitoring for shallow contaminants. Monitoring wells constructed for shallow monitoring[, as defined in 10 CSR 23-4.010,] must have a minimum combined annular seal and ben- tonite seal (if a bentonite seal is [utilized] used) of at least one foot (1'). The following grout types are permitted in monitoring wells: 
(A) Bentonite Slurry-Grout. High solids sodium bentonite slurry, at least twenty to thirty percent (20%–30%) by weight solids, must be tremie grouted from the bottom to the top of the annular space in one (1) continual operation; 
(B) Nonslurry Bentonite. [Sodium bentonite comes in many shapes and sizes. Nonslurry bentonite includes chips, pellets, granules, and powdered varieties.] Chipped or pelletized vari- eties that are designed to fall through standing water may be used when sealing the annulus of a well that is below the saturated zone. Granulated and powdered bentonite must never be poured through standing water because they will flash swell and bridge off before [it gets] getting to the bottom of the annular space. Bentonite chips or pellets may be used to seal portions of the annular space that are in the unsaturated zone. Granulated and powdered varieties are not per- mitted to be used in the unsaturated zone unless they are used to cre- ate a slurry, due to their flash swelling properties which would pre- vent hydration of the complete column of bentonite. When using ben- tonite chips or pellets in the unsaturated zone, it must be hydrated after each three feet (3') interval has been emplaced. To properly hydrate the bentonite, a minimum of three (3) times as much water as bentonite must be used. Water used must be of potable quality; 
(C) Cement Slurry. [Neat cement slurry is a mixture of one (1) ninety-four pound (94 lb.) bag of Portland Type I cement and six (6) gallons of clean water. Five (5) general types of cement are produced: Type I, for general use; Type II, for moderate sulfate resistance or moderate heat of hydration; Type III, for hi-early strength; Type IV, for low heat of hydra- tion; and Type V, for high sulfate resistance. Following are some problems associated with cement slurry grout usage:] 
[1. Type III cement used to produce a hi-early strength and additives that are used to speed up set times of cement slurries cause higher than normal heat of hydration temper- atures. These can only be used in association with metallic

casings or riser pipes with prior approval by the division;] [2.]1. Cement slurry may only be used if additives are incorpo- 
rated to minimize shrinkage. A. [Bentonite is the most commonly used additive to 
prevent shrinkage of cement slurries.] The powdered bentonite additive must be thoroughly mixed with the water before it is added to the cement. Powdered bentonite from two percent to six percent (2%–6%) by weight must be added. [The added bentonite improves the workability of the slurry, reduces shrinkage, and reduces the heat of hydration. This additive does reduce the strength of the seal but is adequate for annular sealing. For each percent of bentonite by weight added to a ninety- four pound (94 lb.) bag of Type I cement an additional six- tenths (.6) gallon of water must be added. The following table sets out the amount of bentonite and water needed to be a ninety-four pound (94 lb.) bag of Type I cement to get from one to six percent (1%–6%) cement-bentonite mix- ture.] 
from vehicles or heavy equipment. The two (2) types of sur- face completion designs are above-ground completions and flush-mount completions]. 
(A) Above-Ground Completions. Above-ground completions must meet the following standards: 
1. The protective casing must extend from at least one and one- half feet (1 1/2') above the finished grade of the ground surface to a point at least two feet (2') below the finished grade, except as stated in [subsection (11)] 10 CSR 23-4.060(10)(B) of this rule for flush- mount completions. [The riser pipe must be at least two inches (2”) below the top of the above-ground completion.] The above-ground completion must be placed in a hole that is at least eight inches (8") in diameter larger than the above-ground comple- tion size. [Care must be taken so that the shape of this hole, when filled with concrete, does not encourage frost heav- ing.] Protective posts are required for above-ground completed monitoring wells in traffic areas. The protective casing must be centered in this hole and concrete poured around the casing to secure it. Cement or bentonite slurry is not allowed. All water must be removed from the enlarged hole before concrete is added. The sur- face of the concrete must slope away from the protective casing so that pooling of surface water does not occur; 
2. A weep hole or alternate method must be employed to ensure water does not accumulate inside the protective casing to the point that the top of the riser is submerged[, except on temporary wells that are plugged within forty-eight (48) hours of initial instal- lation]; and 
3. A locking well cap and a suitable lock must be attached to the top of the above-ground completion. The riser pipe must be sealed with a watertight cap and must extend at least two feet (2') above the finished surface grade in flood prone areas. [Temporary monitoring wells are exempt from this paragraph if they are plugged within forty-eight (48) hours of initial installation; and] 
[4. All monitoring wells must be uniquely identified so as to distinguish one (1) well from another on the monitoring site and on the monitoring well certification form.] 
(B) Flush-Mount Well Completions. [Flush-mount completions must meet the following standards. In a flush-to-ground completion, the flush-mount assembly is installed around the riser pipe that has been cut off below grade.] The flush-mount assembly must be at least eight inches (8") in length and have a tam- per-resistant watertight lid. The riser pipe must be sealed with a watertight cap. The flush-mount surface completion must be set into a hole that is at least eight inches (8") in diameter larger than the diameter of the flush-mount assembly and set in concrete. [This completion must withstand all stresses due to traffic and to freeze thaw processes.] If the monitoring well is being placed through asphalt or concrete, a hole that is a least four inches (4") in diameter larger than the diameter of the flush-mount assembly must be constructed. The flush mount must then be set in concrete. Cement or bentonite slurry is not allowed. 
(C) All monitoring wells must be uniquely identified at the sur- face completion. 
[(11) Wells must be adequate in size and design for the intended use. Wells should be properly developed in order to allow the collection of representative samples from the hori- zon being monitored.] 
[(12)](11) Alternate monitoring well construction procedures, meth- ods, or technologies [will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Written approval in advance by the division is required] may be used provided advanced written approval is obtained from the department.

The tremie pipe must have a side discharge which directs the grout away from the bentonite seal, reducing the potential for infiltration. [Care must be taken so as not to dislodge the bentonite seal that is above the primary filter pack.] The grouting of the annular space must be completed in one (1) continual operation, lifting the tremie pipe as the space fills. [If determined necessary by the division, a staged grouting procedure will be approved] A staged grout- ing procedure may be used provided advanced written approval is obtained from the department; or 
(D) [Other types of grout may be used when necessary and for good cause if prior approval by the division is grant- ed; and] Other types of grout may be used provided advanced written approval is obtained from the department.

composed of bentonite chips or pellets utilizing at least one (1) bag of bentonite resulting in at least a five foot (5') plug. Every forty feet (40') of borehole that exists above the first plug must have a plug set as described in this section. A near surface plug, consisting of bentonite granules or powder, must be set from a point ten feet (10') below the bottom of the trench that connects the closed-loop to the heat pump machine to the base of the trench. All bentonite plugs must be hydrated immediately with six to eight (6–8) gallons of potable water for each bag of bentonite after emplacement if they are in the unsaturated zone. All clean fill material placed between the bentonite plugs must be chlorinated. Clean fill is defined as sand, local drill cuttings, pea gravel, varied sized agricultural lime, or clean aggregate free from contamination. Contractors utilizing this type of grouting method must notify the [division] department at least forty-eight (48) hours prior to beginning any construction on the system. The [division] department will maintain a list of current notification methods (includes, but is not limited to, telephone, fax, email, voice mail, and the department’s online notification system) and contact information available online or upon request. Notification information must include: owner name, owner address, GPS location, date work is to begin, primary contractor name, pri- mary contractor permit number, drilling contractor name, and drilling contractor permit number. 
(8) Approved Grout Materials. The following four (4) grout types are permitted for use in heat pump wells: 
(A) Bentonite Slurry. High solids sodium bentonite slurry must be at least twenty percent to thirty percent (20%–30%) by weight solids to be used as grout. Thickened drilling mud or thinner bentonite slur- ry is strictly prohibited. [Specialized pumps are required to pump a high solids bentonite slurry.] When bentonite slurry is used, it must be applied in one (1) continual motion, through a trem- ie lowered to the grouting point[. It is recommended that full- length grout be used in all vertical closed-loop heat pump wells. The tremie pipe may be removed while the borehole is filled or removed afterward]; 
(B) Nonslurry Bentonite. Only [C]chipped or pelletized bentonite [varieties that are designed to fall through standing water] may [only] be used when sealing the annulus of a well that is below the water level in the saturated zone. [Complete hydration is dif- ficult to achieve when using dry nonslurry bentonite in the unsaturated zone.] All nonslurry sodium bentonite varieties may be used in the unsaturated zone if the hole is dry and no bridging occurs. The dry bentonite must be hydrated after emplacement. [The effective use of nonslurry bentonite as a sealing agent depends on the efficient hydration of the product]; 
(D) Other Grout. Other types of grout may be used if advanced written approval is [granted in advance by the division] obtained by the department. 
(9) Wells that Encounter Karst Conditions. When a borehole encounters caves or larger fractures, [grouting may become diffi- cult.C]chlorinated clean fill, such as gravel or sand, may be used to fill these intervals. Small fractures are effectively sealed by using chipped, hydrated bentonite. If the borehole cannot be grouted as specified, it must be plugged. 
(10) Jetted Heat Pump Wells. Closed-loop heat pump wells that are jetted in Drilling Area 5 (see Figure 5) must [not be deeper that seventy-five feet (75’) and at least the upper] have a mini- mum top grout plug of ten feet (10’) [of borehole must be grout- ed]. 
(11) Heat Pump Wells in Drilling Area 12 (formerly Special Area 3)[. Portions of Franklin County within and south of the city of New Haven are listed as Special Area 3 (Figures 7B and 7C, 10 CSR 23-3.100(7)) due to the contamination of por- tions of the aquifer by one (1) or more of the following 
chemicals of concern: tetrachloroethylene (PCE), trichloroeth- ylene (TCE), PCE degradation products and TCE degradation products or other contaminants of the National Public Drinking Water Regulations (NPDWR). In this area it is neces- sary to utilize more stringent construction standards for new heat pump wells that are drilled into the aquifer. In Special Area 3 a qualified and properly trained individual shall collect all groundwater samples for analysis of chemicals of con- cern.] may be constructed provided advanced written approval is obtained from the department pursuant to 10 CSR 23-3.090(12). 
[(A) The division shall be consulted before constructing a new heat pump well in Special Area 3. The division will pro- vide specific guidance on heat pump well drilling protocol and construction specifications on a case-by-case basis. The division must provide written approval for all new heat pump wells in Special Area 3 prior to construction. 
(B) All drilling-derived fluids and solid materials from heat pump wells drilled in Special Area 3 shall be containerized, sampled, and managed pursuant to Missouri hazardous waste management regulations. 
(C) Any heat pump well drilling operation, in which PCE and/or TCE is encountered in a pure-product phase (also known as dense non-aqueous phase liquid or DNAPL), drilling shall cease and the division shall be notified immedi- ately. The division will determine further action.] 
(12) Heat Pump Wells in Drilling Area 13 (formerly Special Area 4)[. Portions of St. Charles County west of the city of Weldon Spring are listed as Special Area 4 (Figure 7D, 10 CSR 23-3.100(8)) due to the contamination of portions of the aquifer by one (1) or more of the following chemicals of concern: trinitrotoluene (TNT) and dinitrotoluene (DNT) at the Army Corps of Engineers (COE) site, 2,4,6-TNT, 2,4- DNT, 2,6-DNT, dinitrobenzene (1,3-DB), nitrobenzene (NB), nitrate, uranium, and trichloroethylene (TCE) at the Department of Energy (DOE) main site, uranium and 2,4- DNT at the DOE Quarry, or other contaminants of the National Public Drinking Water Regulations (NPDWR). In this area it is necessary to utilize more stringent construction standards for new heat pump wells that are drilled into or through the shallow aquifer defined as the Burlington Keokuk/Fern Glen formation(s) at the main site and the Kimmswick limestone at the DOE Quarry. In Special Area 4 a qualified and properly trained individual shall collect all groundwater samples for analysis of chemicals of concern. Sampling qualifications and training requirements will be determined in advance of sampling by the division and approval will be issued in written format.] may be constructed provided advanced written approval is obtained from the depart- ment pursuant to 10 CSR 23-3.090(13). 
[(A) The division shall be consulted before constructing a new heat pump well in Special Area 4. The division will pro- vide specific guidance on heat pump well drilling protocol and construction specifications on a case-by-case basis. The division must provide written approval for all new heat pump wells prior to construction. 
(B) All drilling-derived fluids and solid materials shall be containerized, sampled, and managed pursuant to Missouri hazardous waste management regulations.]

PURPOSE: The title of this rule is being amended because Closed- Loop Heat Pump Systems That Use Refrigerants as the Heat Transfer Fluid are no longer allowed and to improve readability by removing unnecessary language. 
[(1) Open-loop heat pump systems and their installers that utilize existing surface water supply which is plumbed through the heat pump machine and returned to the same surface water supply are exempt from these rules.] 
[(2)](1) Open-[L]loop [Heat Pump Systems and G]groundwater [S]supply [W]wells[. An open-loop heat pump uses groundwa- ter produced from wells which are plumbed through the heat pump machine where the heat transfer of the groundwater is accomplished. The groundwater is then utilized at the sur- face or returned to the ground via a return well. Any newly drilled or reconstructed well utilized for supply or return water must meet the construction standards set out in 10 CSR 23-3.] shall be constructed to domestic/multifamily well standards pursuant to 10 CSR 23-3.030(1) if it produces less than seventy (70) gallons per minute and to high yield well standards pursuant to 10 CSR 23-3.030(3) if it produces more than seventy (70) gallons of water per minute. Any well that was constructed before October 1987 that is utilized as the water supply or return for an open-loop heat pump system is exempt from these rules, except that the surface disposal of the water may [fall under the Division of Environmental Quality rules and the return of the pro- duced water via a well must meet rules set out in this sec- tion] be subject to other regulations. 
[(3)](2) Heat pump systems and [S]surface [D]disposal of [U]used [W]water[. After the water passes through the heat pump machine, it may be disposed of to the surface only if the water remains on the landowner’s property. It may not be run to drainage that leaves the property unless applicable permits are secured through the Water Protection Program, Division of Environmental Quality. If the heat pump utilizes more than twenty-five (25) gallons of water per minute when it is in operation, surface disposal of the used water is 
prohibited.] may require a permit pursuant to 10 CSR 20-6. 
[(4)](3) Open loop [W]water [R]return [and Supply W]wells [for Domestic Heat Pump Applications. Water return wells] shall [meet the requirements set out in 10 CSR 23 Chapters 1, 2, and 3 concerning casing, casing depth, well seal, borehole, grouting, and reporting.] be constructed to domestic/multifam- ily well standards pursuant to 10 CSR 23-3.030(1) if it produces less than seventy (70) gallons per minute and to high yield well standards pursuant to 10 CSR 23-3.030(3) if it produces more than seventy (70) gallons of water per minute. The depth of the [water] return well [must not exceed the depth of the water supply well.] shall be a similar depth as the supply well and the [W]water must be returned to the same aquifer[, at a similar depth that it was taken from in the water supply well. A sanitary well seal or a pitless adapter may be used, and]. [t]The water return pipe must extend at least twenty feet (20') below the static water level. 
[(5) Water Return Wells for Nondomestic Heat Pump Applications. Specifications for water return wells in other than domestic applications will be determined on a case-by- case basis by the division, taking into account the water quality and quantity, geology, hydrology and water usage in the area. 
(6) To drill and construct an open-loop heat pump well or a water return well, the driller must have a nonrestricted water well installation permit.]

[(2) Test Holes Drilled to Expand Quarrying and Surface Mining Operations. When test holes are drilled in the process of expanding quarrying and surface mining operations and are destroyed within one (1) year by the advance of the mine or quarry, they are required to be plugged by only inserting a temporary surface plug into the hole which will prevent surface water from entering the hole. Reporting require- ments are not required for these temporary holes. If these test holes are drilled deeper than the quarry or mine floor, they must be plugged from the mine floor to the total depth of the hole with approved grout. If these holes are not destroyed by the mining process within one (1) year then the requirements of subsection (1)(A) must be met. Extensions of this time limit will be considered on a case-by-case basis by the division. 
(3) Test Holes Drilled in Association with Clay Mining Operations , Shallow Industrial Minerals Exploration and Miscellaneous Geologic Data Holes. 
(A) When the test hole is drilled that bottoms in an imper- meable fire clay deposit a temporary surface plug must be inserted which prevents surface water from entering the hole. This type of well is exempted from reporting require- ments. 
(B) When a test hole is drilled that bottoms at the bedrock- unconsolidated material contact or above, it must be plugged when no longer needed for exploratory purposes. If the test hole is less than one hundred feet (100’) in depth and does not encounter a potable water horizon, the test hole must be plugged by filling the hole from bottom to top with the type of uncontaminated material removed from the hole or other approved grout. A registration report is required per site for holes drilled and plugged that are greater than twenty feet (20’) in depth. One (1) registration fee is required per report form for this type of hole. If a test hole is less than twenty feet (20’) in depth, it must be filled with the material removed from the hole as soon as it is no longer needed for exploratory purposes. Test holes less than twenty feet (20’) in depth are exempted from the rules. These wells can not be used in any way relative to monitoring well sites. 
(C) If a test hole is greater than one hundred feet (>100’) in depth, it must be plugged as stated in 10 CSR 23- 6.050(1).]
