HOW TO CITE RULES AND RSMO 
RULES 
The rules are codified in the Code of State Regulations in this system– 
Title Division Chapter Rule 
3 CSR 10- 4 .115 Department Code of Agency General area Specific area 
State Division regulated regulated Regulations 
and should be cited in this manner: 3 CSR 10-4.115. 
Each department of state government is assigned a title. Each agency or division in the department is assigned a division number. The agency then groups its rules into general subject matter areas called chapters and specific areas called rules. Within a rule, the first breakdown is called a section and is designated as (1). Subsection is (A) with further breakdown into paragraphs 1., subparagraphs A., parts (I), subparts (a), items I. and subitems a. 
The rule is properly cited by using the full citation, for example, 3 CSR 10-4.115 NOT Rule 10-4.115. Citations of RSMo are to the Missouri Revised Statutes as of the date indicated. 
Code and Register on the Internet 
The Code of State Regulations and Missouri Register are available on the Internet. The Code address is www.sos.mo.gov/adrules/csr/csr The Register address is www.sos.mo.gov/adrules/moreg/moreg These websites contain rulemakings and regulations as they appear in the Code and Registers.

Proposed Rules 
MISSOURI REGISTER 

Under this heading will appear the text of proposed rules and changes. The notice of proposed rulemaking is required to contain an explanation of any new rule or any change in an existing rule and the reasons therefor. This is set out in the Purpose section with each rule. Also required is a citation to the legal authority to make rules. This appears fol- lowing the text of the rule, after the word “Authority.” Entirely new rules are printed without any special symbol- 
ogy under the heading of proposed rule. If an existing rule is to be amended or rescinded, it will have a heading of proposed amendment or proposed rescission. Rules which are proposed to be amended will have new matter printed in boldface type and matter to be deleted placed in brackets. An important function of the Missouri Register is to solicit 
and encourage public participation in the rulemaking process. The law provides that for every proposed rule, amendment, or rescission there must be a notice that anyone may comment on the proposed action. This comment may take different forms. If an agency is required by statute to hold a public hearing 
before making any new rules, then a Notice of Public Hearing will appear following the text of the rule. Hearing dates must be at least thirty (30) days after publication of the notice in the Missouri Register. If no hearing is planned or required, the agency must give a Notice to Submit Comments. This allows anyone to file statements in support of or in opposition to the proposed action with the agency within a specified time, no less than thirty (30) days after pub- lication of the notice in the Missouri Register. 
An agency may hold a public hearing on a rule even though not required by law to hold one. If an agency allows comments to be received following the hearing date, the close of comments date will be used as the beginning day in the ninety- (90-) day-count necessary for the filing of the order of rulemaking. 
If an agency decides to hold a public hearing after planning not to, it must withdraw the earlier notice and file a new notice of proposed rulemaking and schedule a hearing for a date not less than thirty (30) days from the date of publication of the new notice. 
Proposed Amendment Text Reminder: Boldface text indicates new matter. [Bracketed text indicates matter being deleted.]

within thirty (30) days after publication of this notice in the Missouri Register. No public hearing is scheduled. 
Title 2—DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Division 60—Grain Inspection and Warehousing Chapter 2—Grain Sampling 
PROPOSED RESCISSION 
2 CSR 60-2.010 Grain Sampling. The director of the Department of Agriculture was authorized to establish all necessary and reason- able regulations and fees for sampling grain whenever the value of grain was established by analysis of a sample drawn by the buyer or his/her representative. This rule established a method that allowed the seller that was dissatisfied with the buyer’s grade to obtain an official analysis of his lot of grain from an official grain inspection laboratory of the Department of Agriculture. 
PURPOSE: The rule states, in section (8), it was only in effect until January 1, 1979, unless renewed prior to that date by the director. This rule has not been renewed and is outdated and not necessary. 265.505, RSMo provides adequate guidelines to protect sellers’ inter- est. 
AUTHORITY: section 265.505, RSMo 1986. Original rule filed Oct. 14, 1976, effective Jan. 14, 1977. Rescinded: Filed May 18, 2018. 
PUBLIC COST: This proposed rescission will not cost state agencies or political subdivisions more than five hundred dollars ($500) in the aggregate. 
PRIVATE COST: This proposed rescission will not cost private enti- ties more than five hundred dollars ($500) in the aggregate. 
NOTICE TO SUBMIT COMMENTS: Anyone may submit a written statement in support of or in opposition to this proposed rescission. Written statements shall be sent to the attention of Joe Walker, Grain Regulatory Services, PO Box 630, Jefferson City, MO 65102. Comments may also be made on the Department of Agriculture’s website: mda.mo.gov.

PROPOSED RESCISSION 
2 CSR 60-4.016 Application of Law. This rule explained the inter- pretation made by the department regarding the application of Missouri Grain Warehouse Law as provided in section 411.681, RSMo. 
PURPOSE: This rule is outdated and unnecessary. 411.015, RSMo provides that all grain warehouses fall under the provision of the Missouri Grain Warehouse Law (411, RSMo). 2 CSR 60-4.015 pro- vides for exemption of train warehouses licensed under the United States Warehouse Act to avoid duplication of licenses and obtrusive burden to the business.

PURPOSE: The rule is outdated and unnecessary. 411.030, RSMo provides the exclusive right for the Department of Agriculture to offi- cially inspect and grade all grains for which standards have been established under the United States Grain Standards Act. Section 411.060, RSMo further clarifies that official inspection and weighing of grain will be performed by persons appointed by the Director of Agriculture.

PURPOSE: This rule is unnecessary. 411.283 and 411.750, RSMo require licensees to provide safe working conditions for employees of the Department of Agriculture. This rule is a duplication of 411.283 and 411.759, RSMo.

Title 4—DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Division 240—Public Service Commission Chapter 10—Utilities 
PROPOSED RULE 
4 CSR 240-10.085 Incentives for Acquisition of Nonviable Utilities 
PURPOSE: The purpose of this proposed rule is to create a process for a water or sewer utility to propose an acquisition incentive to encourage acquisition of nonviable water or sewer utilities by a water or sewer utility with the resources to rehabilitate the acquired utility within a reasonable time frame. 
(1) As used in this rule, the following terms mean: (A) Nonviable utility— 
1. A utility that is in violation of statutory or regulatory stan- dards that affect the safety and adequacy of the service provided, including, but not limited to, the public service commission law, the federal clean water law, the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, as amended, and the regulations adopted under these laws; 
2. A utility that has failed to comply, within a reasonable period of time, with any order of the department of natural resources or the commission concerning the safety and adequacy of service; 
3. A utility that is not reasonably expected to furnish and main- tain safe and adequate service and facilities in the future; or 
4. A utility that is insolvent; (B) Rate of return premiums. Additional rate of return basis points, 
up to one hundred (100) basis points, awarded at the commission’s discretion in recognition of risks involved in acquisition of nonviable utilities and the associated system improvement costs; 
(C) Debit acquisition adjustment. Adjustments to an acquiring util- ity’s rate base to reflect a portion or all of the excess acquisition cost over depreciated original cost of the acquired system; and 
(D) Plant-in-service study. A report detailing a determination of the value of the original costs of the property of a public utility that requires the acquiring utility to accumulate the records and account- ing details in order to support reasonable plant, reserve, and contri- butions in aid of construction balances. 
(2) An application for an acquisition incentive in the form of a rate of return premium and/or debit acquisition adjustment must be filed at the beginning of a case seeking authority under sections 393.190 or 393.170, RSMo. If the commission determines the request for an acquisition incentive is in the public interest, it shall grant the request. The commission may apply a rate of return premium and/or debit acquisition adjustment in the applicant’s next rate case proceed- ing following acquisition of a nonviable utility if the commission determines it will not result in unjust or unreasonable rates. 
(3) Filing Requirements— (A) An application for an acquisition incentive to acquire a nonvi- 
able utility shall include the following: 1. A statement as to whether the nonviable utility is related to 
the operation of another utility (for example, a water or sewer system providing service to the same or similar service area) and whether the related utility operation is part of the transaction; 
2. Records related to the original cost of the nonviable utility. The acquiring utility must exercise due diligence and make reason- able attempts to obtain, from the seller, documents related to original 
cost. In particular, as part of its exercise of due diligence, the acquir- ing utility shall request, from the seller, for purposes of conducting the plant-in-service study, records relating to the original cost of the assets being acquired and records relating to contributions in aid of construction (CIAC) amounts, including: 
A. Accounting records and other relevant documentation, and agreements of donations of contributions, services, or property from states, municipalities, or other government agencies, individuals, and others for construction purposes; 
B. Records of un-refunded balances in customer advances for construction (CAC); 
C. Records of customer tap-in fees and hook-up fees; D. Prior original cost studies; E. Records of local, state, and federal grants used for con- 
struction of utility plant; F. Relevant commission records; G. A summary of the depreciation schedules from all filed 
federal tax returns; and H. Other accounting records supporting plant-in-service; and 
3. If the system to be acquired is part of a larger transaction involving multiple systems of which some do not qualify as nonvi- able, a detailed revenue and rate base plan describing how the acquir- ing utility will only apply the sought acquisition adjustment to the nonviable system(s) within the larger transaction; 
(B) If any of the items required under paragraph (3)(A)2. are unavailable at the time the application is filed, they shall be furnished by the acquiring utility prior to the next rate case; and 
(C) The failure of a seller to provide cost-related documents, after reasonable attempts to obtain the data, will not be a basis for the acquiring utility to provide incomplete information about the value of the acquired system’s assets in its proposed rate base. Any informa- tion not available from the seller shall be estimated by the acquiring utility, along with documentation supporting the reasonableness of the estimates developed. 
(4) When submitting an application for an acquisition incentive to acquire a nonviable utility, the acquiring utility has the burden of proof and shall demonstrate the following: 
(A) The acquiring utility is not a nonviable utility and will not be materially impaired by the acquisition; 
(B) The acquiring utility maintains the managerial, technical, and financial capabilities to safely and adequately operate the system to be acquired; 
(C) The system to be acquired is a nonviable utility; 
(D) The purchase price and financial terms of the acquisition are fair and reasonable and have been reached through arm’s-length negotiations; 
(E) Any plant improvements necessary to make the utility viable will be completed within a period of time no longer than three (3) years after the effective date of acquisition; 
(F) How managerial or operational deficiencies that can be cor- rected without capital improvements will be corrected within six (6) months of the acquisition; 
(G) How capital improvements and operational changes planned within the next three (3) years will correct deficiencies; 
(H) The acquisition is in the public interest; and 
(I) The acquisition would be unlikely to occur without the proba- bility of obtaining an acquisition incentive. 
(5) If the acquisition incentive is approved by the commission, the utility shall file a rate case no later than twelve (12) months after commission approval of the acquisition or within the period of time as ordered by the commission in section 393.190 or 393.170, RSMo case, unless the utility requests and the commission otherwise approves. Rate impacts of the approved incentive mechanism will go into effect upon order of the commission at the conclusion of that first rate case proceeding. If the acquisition incentive is approved in section 393.190 or 393.170, RSMo case, prior to its next rate case,

If evidence supports other CIAC that was not booked by the seller, the acquiring utility shall make an effort, supported with documentation, to determine the actual CIAC and record the contributions for ratemaking purposes, such as lot sale agreements or capitalization vs. expense of plant-in-service on tax returns; 
(B) Identify all plant retirements and plant no longer used and use- ful, and complete the appropriate accounting entries; and 
(C) If the records are not available from the acquired system to complete subsection (5)(A) or (5)(B), on a going-forward basis, cre- ate and maintain documentation of (5)(A) and (5)(B) from the date of acquisition. 
(6) If a debit acquisition adjustment is approved, in its next rate case proceeding, an acquiring utility shall file a plant-in-service study to support the amount of its requested acquisition adjustment addition to its rate base. The acquiring utility shall reconcile and explain any discrepancies between the acquiring utility’s plant-in-service study of original cost valuation and the commission’s records, to the extent reasonably known and available to the acquiring utility, at the same time the supporting documentation for the study is filed. Any dis- putes regarding the acquiring utility’s plant-in-service study will be resolved in that first subsequent rate case proceeding. 
(7) Nothing in the rule precludes an acquiring utility that pays less than the depreciated original cost of the acquired system from seek- ing to include in rate base an amount up to the depreciated original cost of the acquired system. 
(8) Provisions of this rule may be waived by the commission for good cause shown.

PROPOSED RULE 
4 CSR 240-10.095 Environmental Improvement Contingency Fund 
PURPOSE: This rule provides parameters and procedures for small water and/or sewer utilities to request a special fund to collect rev- enue from customers to make improvements necessitated by environ- mental regulations. 
(1) For the purposes of this rule only, a water or sewer utility serving eight thousand (8,000) or fewer customers shall be considered a small utility. 
(2) A small utility or commission staff may request establishment of an Environmental Improvement Contingency Fund (EICF) during the course of a rate case, whether filed pursuant to 4 CSR 240-10.075 or section 393.150, RSMo. 
(3) Following the request for an EICF, the staff will— (A) Investigate the small utility’s financial resources and its ability 
to finance capital improvements; (B) Conduct a managerial audit to determine the quality of the 
small utility’s management; and (C) Conduct a comprehensive review of the necessary improve- 
ments at the small utility. 
(4) An EICF may only go into effect if, at the conclusion of the rate case where the small utility or commission staff requests an ECIF, the commission approves the following items: 
(A) A list of necessary improvements. 1. The list of necessary improvements may only include those 
improvements that— A. Are directly related to environmental rules, regulations, or 
orders of the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (DNR), the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), or other reg- ulatory authority including, but not limited to, federal, state, or local authorities, city ordinances, and the state attorney general; and 
B. Are reasonably anticipated to be completed within five (5) years of the effective date of new rates, although, for good cause shown, the commission may consider projects that require longer to complete; and 
2. During the rate case, upon request by the small utility or by direction of the commission, staff will assist the utility in identifying a list of necessary improvements; 
(B) An estimated amount of funds necessary for the improvements in the list described in subsection (4)(A). 
1. Staff and the small utility will submit the estimated amount of funds necessary for the improvements, which may include costs for preliminary engineering reports related to those improvements. 
2. The percentage of the estimated amount collectable through an EICF will be based on an analysis of the needs of the small utility and its ability to secure financing through normal debt or equity sources. The commission may give special consideration to requests that do not require full funding of the estimated amount collectible. 
3. If a requested EICF includes funds for a preliminary engi- neering report, the report must be completed and submitted to the commission prior to the first disbursement from the EICF account; and 
(C) A schedule for completion of the list of improvements required by subsection (4)(A). Upon request by the small utility or by direc- tion of the commission, staff will assist the small utility in preparing such a schedule.

(5) The EICF must be collected as a part of the customer charge on customers’ bills. 
(A) Revenues collected must be recorded by the small utility and placed into a commission-approved account specifically segregated from all other utility accounts, for the explicit purpose of regulatory review and tracking. 
(B) Funds held in the EICF account shall only be disbursed to pay for projects approved during the rate case as noted in section (4) above. 
(C) Disbursements from the EICF account shall only be made after notice to staff and public counsel. 
1. The notice must be sent to staff and public counsel at least thirty (30) days prior to a disbursement. 
2. If any party objects to the proposed disbursement, detailed objections must be filed in the official case file in which the EICF was approved no later than ten (10) days after receiving the disburse- ment notice. The commission may then determine whether or not to approve the requested disbursement of the funds. 
3. If no timely objection is raised or staff and public counsel notify the small utility they agree to the disbursement, the small util- ity may make the disbursement described in its notice no later than the date specified in that notice. 
4. The commission will resolve any dispute regarding the pro- posed disbursements prior to the specified disbursement date. 
(6) Every quarter after receiving commission approval of an EICF, the small utility shall submit documentation to staff and public coun- sel reporting— 
(A) Monthly EICF funds received from customers; (B) Monthly EICF deposits to the escrow account; (C) Monthly EICF expenditures; and (D) End-of-month balance of the EICF account. 
(7) After an EICF is established, the small utility shall file a subse- quent rate request no later than five (5) years after the effective date of the EICF, during which— 
(A) Any monies expended from the fund shall be treated as con- tributions-in-aid-of-construction for purposes of setting rates for the small utility. The EICF will be trued-up and will be reviewed to determine if it should— 
1. Remain in effect at the current rate; or 2. Remain in effect at a different rate; or 3. Be terminated. 
(8) Staff or the public counsel may, at their discretion, bring before the commission a complaint against the small utility seeking both civil penalties and direction from the commission to promptly stop all collection of an EICF if, upon review of documentation described in section (6) above, staff, public counsel, or another regulatory authority has indication that the small utility has used EICF funds for any purpose other than as approved by the commission.

(A) Accumulation period means the time period set by the commission in the general rate proceeding over which historical fuel and purchased power costs and fuel-related revenues are accumulated for purposes of determining the actual net energy costs (ANEC). An accumulation period may be a time period between three (3) and twelve (12) months with the timing and number of accumulation periods to be determined in the general rate proceeding establishing, continuing, or modifying the FAC; 
(B) Actual net energy costs (ANEC) means prudently incurred fuel and purchased power costs minus fuel-related revenues of a rate adjustment mechanism (RAM) during the accumulation period; 
(C) Base energy costs means the fuel and purchased power costs net of fuel-related revenues determined by the commission to be included in a RAM that are also included in the revenue requirement used to set base rates in a general rate case; 
(D) Base factor (BF) means the base energy costs per kilowatt hour (kWh) measured at the regional transmission organization’s applicable price node for the electric utility’s load or, if the elec- tric utility is not a participant in a regional transmission organi- zation, at the generator. The base factor(s) shall be established in a general rate proceeding and may vary by season of the year;

[(F)](P) Interim energy charge (IEC) means [a refundable fixed charge,] a mechanism that includes a refundable fixed amount billed through an interim energy rate (IER) established in a gen- eral rate proceeding[,] that permits an electric utility to recover some or all of its fuel and purchased power costs separate from the fuel and purchased power costs included in its base rates. [An IEC may or may not include offsystem sales and revenues and associated costs. The commission shall determine whether or not to reflect off-system sales revenues and associated costs in an IEC in the general rate proceeding that establish- es, continues or modifies the IEC;] Base energy cost in the base rates is the floor of the IEC. The base energy cost plus the fuel and purchased power costs billed through the IER is the ceiling of the IEC. An IEC may or may not include fuel-related revenues and costs related to those revenues; 
(Q) Megawatt hour (mWh) is one (1) million watt hours or one thousand (1,000) kilowatt hours (kWh);

[(I) True-up year means the twelve (12)-month period beginning on the first day of the first calendar month follow- ing the effective date of the commission order approving a RAM unless the effective date is on the first day of the cal- endar month. If the effective date of the commission order approving a rate mechanism is on the first day of a calendar month, then the true-up year begins on the effective date of the commission order. The first annual true-up period shall end on the last day of the twelfth calendar month following 

Page 1428 
Proposed Rules 
July 2, 2018 Vol. 43, No. 13 
the effective date of the commission order establishing the RAM. Subsequent true-up years shall be the succeeding twelve (12)-month periods. If a general rate proceeding is concluded prior to the conclusion of a true-up year, the true- up year may be less than twelve (12) months.] 
(Z) True-up amount means— 1. For a FAC, the true-up amount shall be the difference 
between the FPA and the utility’s aggregate FAC charges billed for a recovery period. If the aggregate FAC charges billed for recovery period are more than the FPA, the true-up amount will be negative. If the aggregate FAC charges billed for a recovery period are less than the FPA, the true-up amount will be positive. 
A. The electric utility may request in its general rate case to use the final Regional Transmission Organization (RTO) deter- minants to update the FPA for its true-up if the electric utility belongs to an RTO where the RTO may, after the beginning of the recovery period, finalize the determinants used to calculate the FPA for the recovery period. 
2. For an IEC, the true-up amount shall be determined as follows for each consecutive twelve- (12-) month period— 
A. If the actual fuel and purchased power cost is greater than the IEC ceiling, the true-up amount shall be zero; 
B. If the actual fuel and purchased power cost is less than the IEC ceiling and greater than the IEC floor, the true-up amount shall be the difference between the actual fuel and pur- chased power cost and the combined IEC billed plus the base energy cost. The customers will be credited/refunded this amount; or 
C. If the actual fuel and purchased power cost is less than the IEC floor, the true-up amount shall be the aggregate IEC billed. The customers will be credited/refunded this amount. 
(2) [Applications to Establish, Continue or Modify a RAM. Pursuant to the provisions of this rule, 4 CSR 240-2.060 and section 386.266, RSMo, only] Establishment, Continuance, or Modification of a RAM. [a]An electric utility may only file a request with the commission to establish, continue, or modify a RAM in a general rate proceeding [may file an application with the commission to establish, continue or modify a RAM by fil- ing tariff schedules]. Any party in a general rate proceeding [in which a RAM is effective or proposed] may seek to continue, modify, or oppose the RAM. The commission shall approve, modify, or reject such [applications to establish a RAM] request only after providing the opportunity for a full hearing in a general rate proceed- ing. The commission shall consider all relevant factors that may affect the costs or overall rates and charges of the petitioning electric utility. 
[(A) The commission may approve the establishment, con- tinuation or modification of a RAM and associated rate schedules provided that it finds that the RAM it approves is reasonably designed to provide the electric utility with a suf- ficient opportunity to earn a fair return on equity and so long as the rate schedules that implement the RAM conform to the RAM approved by the commission. 
(B) The commission may take into account any change in business risk to the utility resulting from establishment, con- tinuation or modification of the RAM in setting the electric utility’s allowed return in any rate proceeding, in addition to any other changes in business risk experienced by the elec- tric utility. 
(C) In determining which cost components to include in a RAM, the commission will consider, but is not limited to only considering, the magnitude of the costs, the ability of the utility to manage the costs, the volatility of the cost compo- nent and the incentive provided to the utility as a result of the inclusion or exclusion of the cost component. The com- mission may, in its discretion, determine what portion of pru- dently incurred fuel and purchased power costs may be recovered in a RAM and what portion shall be recovered in 
base rates. (D) The electric utility shall include in its initial notice to 
customers regarding the general rate case, a commission approved description of how the costs passed through the proposed RAM requested shall be applied to monthly bills.]

[(E)](D) Any party to the general rate proceeding may oppose [the establishment, continuation or modification of a] any RAM and/or may propose alternative RAMs for the commission’s consid- eration [including but not limited to modifications to the elec- tric utility’s proposed RAM]. 
[(F)](E) The RAM, and [periodic adjustments thereto] any adjustments to the FARs if a FAC is approved, shall be based on historical fuel and purchased power costs and fuel-related revenues. 
[(G) The electric utility shall meet the filing requirements in 4 CSR 240-3.161(2) in conjunction with an application to establish a RAM and 4 CSR 240-3.161(3) in conjunction with an application to continue or modify a RAM.] 
(F) For an electric utility with a FAC, the utility shall include in its proposed tariff sheets provisions which shall accurately and appropriately remedy any true-up amount as part of the electric utility’s determination of its FPA for a change to its FARs. The proposed tariff sheets shall include, at a minimum: 
1. When the electric utility will file for a true-up; 
2. How the true-up amount will be determined including, but not limited to, any recalculation of the FPA; and 
3. How and when the true-up amount will be recovered. For an electric utility with an IEC mechanism, a true-up must be filed within sixteen (16) months of the operation of law date of the IEC and be filed annually thereafter. 
[(H)](G) Any party to the general rate proceeding may propose a cap on the [change in the FAC, reasonably designed] periodic changes to the fuel adjustment rate (FAR), to mitigate volatility in rates, provided it proposes a method for the utility to recover all of the costs it would be entitled to recover in the FAC, together with interest thereon. 
(3) [Application for Discontinuation of a RAM. The commis- sion shall allow or require the rate schedules that define and implement a RAM to be discontinued and withdrawn only after providing the] Discontinuance of a RAM. The tariff sheets that define and implement a RAM shall only be discontinued and withdrawn after the opportunity for a full hearing in a general rate proceeding. The commission shall consider all relevant factors that affect ratepayers, the cost or overall rates, and charges of the peti- tioning electric utility. 
(A) When an electric utility files a general rate proceeding in which it requests that its RAM be discontinued, the electric util- ity shall file with the commission, and serve on the parties, the following supporting information, in electronic format where

Proposed Rules 
July 2, 2018 Vol. 43, No. 13 
available (with formulas intact), as part of, or in addition to, its direct testimony: 
1. An example of the notice to be provided to customers regarding the general rate case to be approved by the commis- sion, and a description of why it believes the RAM should be dis- continued; 
2. A detailed explanation of how the electric utility proposes to discontinue its RAM. 
A. If requesting to discontinue its FAC, the electric utility shall include the following in its explanation: 
(I) The ending date of the last FAC accumulation peri- 
od; 
(II) The beginning and ending dates of the recovery period for that accumulation period; and 
(III) The procedure for the true-up associated with the recovery period for that accumulation period. 
B. If requesting to discontinue its IEC, the electric utility shall include a detailed explanation of how any over-billing will be returned to the electric utility’s retail customers; 
3. A detailed explanation of why the RAM is no longer nec- essary to provide the electric utility a sufficient opportunity to earn a fair return on equity; 
4. A detailed explanation of any impact on setting the elec- tric utility’s allowed return on equity in any rate proceeding as a result of the change to the electric utility’s business risk resulting from discontinuation of its RAM, in addition to any other changes in business risk experienced by the electric utility; 
5. Any additional information that the commission ordered the electric utility to provide when seeking to discontinue its RAM. 
[(A)](B) Any party to the general rate proceeding may oppose the discontinuation of a RAM on the grounds that the utility is oppor- tunistically discontinuing the RAM due to declining fuel or pur- chased power costs and/or increasing [off-system sales] fuel-relat- ed revenues. If the commission finds that the utility is opportunisti- cally seeking to discontinue the RAM for any of these reasons, the commission shall not allow the RAM to be discontinued, and shall order its continuation or modification. In addition to other reme- dies provided by law, the commission may reject the utility’s request for discontinuance of a RAM if it finds that the utility has not complied with this rule in its request to discontinue its RAM. To continue or modify the RAM under such circumstances, the commission must find that it provides the electric utility with a sufficient opportunity to earn a fair rate of return on equity and the [rate schedules] tariff sheets filed to implement the RAM must conform to the RAM approved by the commission. Any RAM and periodic adjustments [thereto] to the FAR shall be based on histor- ical fuel and purchased power costs. 
[(B)](C) The commission may take into account any change in business risk [to the corporation] of the electric utility resulting from discontinuance of the RAM in setting the electric utility’s allowed return on equity in any general rate proceeding[,] in addi- tion to any other changes in the electric utility’s business risk [experienced by the electric utility]. 
[(C) The electric utility shall include in its initial notice to customers, regarding the general rate case, a commission approved description of why it believes the RAM should be discontinued. 
(D) Subsections (2)(A) through (C), (F) and (G) shall apply to any proposal for continuation or modification. 
(E) The electric utility shall meet the filing requirements in 4 CSR 240-3.161(4).] 
[(4) Periodic Adjustments of FACs. If an electric utility files proposed rate schedules to adjust its FAC rates between general rate proceedings, the staff shall examine and analyze the information filed by the electric utility in accordance with 4 CSR 240-3.161 and additional information obtained 
through discovery, if any, to determine if the proposed adjustment to the FAC is in accordance with the provisions of this rule, section 386.266, RSMo and the FAC mecha- nism established in the most recent general rate proceeding. The staff shall submit a recommendation regarding its exam- ination and analysis to the commission not later than thirty (30) days after the electric utility files its tariff schedules to adjust its FAC rates. If the FAC rate adjustment is in accor- dance with the provisions of this rule, section 386.266, RSMo, and the FAC mechanism established in the most recent general rate proceeding, the commission shall either issue an interim rate adjustment order approving the tariff schedules and the FAC rate adjustments within sixty (60) days of the electric utility’s filing or, if no such order is issued, the tariff schedules and the FAC rate adjustments shall take effect sixty (60) days after the tariff schedules were filed. If the FAC rate adjustment is not in accordance with the provisions of this rule, section 386.266, RSMo, or the FAC mechanism established in the most recent rate pro- ceeding, the commission shall reject the proposed rate schedules within sixty (60) days of the electric utility’s filing and may instead order implementation of an appropriate interim rate schedule(s). 
(A) An electric utility with a FAC shall file one (1) manda- tory adjustment to its FAC in each true-up year coinciding with the true-up of its FAC. It may also file up to three (3) additional adjustments to its FAC within a true-up year with the timing and number of such additional filings to be deter- mined in the general rate proceeding establishing the FAC and in general rate proceedings thereafter. 
(B) The electric utility must be current on its submission of its Surveillance Monitoring Reports as required in section (10) and its monthly reporting requirements as required by 4 CSR 240-3.161(5) in order for the commission to process the electric utility’s requested FAC adjustment increasing rates. 
(C) If the staff, Office of the Public Counsel (OPC) or other party which receives, pursuant to a protective order, the information that the electric utility is required to submit in 4 CSR 240-3.161 and as ordered by the commission in a pre- vious proceeding, believes that the information required to be submitted pursuant to 4 CSR 240-3.161 and the com- mission order establishing the RAM has not been submitted in compliance with that rule, it shall notify the electric utility within ten (10) days of the electric utility’s filing of an appli- cation or tariff schedules to adjust the FAC rates and identify the information required. The electric utility shall supply the information identified by the party, or shall notify the party that it believes the information provided was in compliance with the requirements of 4 CSR 240-3.161, within ten (10) days of the request. If the electric utility does not timely supply the information, the party asserting the failure to pro- vide the required information must timely file a motion to compel with the commission. While the commission is con- sidering the motion to compel, the processing timeline for the adjustment to increase FAC rates shall be suspended. If the commission then issues an order requiring the informa- tion be provided, the time necessary for the information to be provided shall further extend the processing timeline for the adjustment to increase FAC rates. For good cause shown the commission may further suspend this timeline. Any delay in providing sufficient information in compliance with 4 CSR 240-3.161 in a request to decrease FAC rates shall not alter the processing timeline.] 
(4) Requirements for Electric Utilities that have a RAM. If the commission grants, modifies, or continues an electric utility’s RAM, the electric utility shall—

(F) The tariff sheets reflecting the RAM define the costs and revenues that can be included in the RAM, subject to the following: 
1. If an RTO implements a new market settlement type that the electric utility or another party believes possesses the characteristics of, and is of the nature of, an RTO revenue or cost type approved by the commission for inclusion in the elec- tric utility’s FAC in the previous general rate increase, the elec- tric utility shall include the new market settlement type subject to the following requirements: 
A. The party proposing the inclusion of a new market set- tlement type shall make a filing before the commission. 
(I) If the electric utility is proposing the inclusion of a new market settlement type, it will make a filing with the com- mission giving notice of the new cost or revenue type no later than sixty (60) days prior to the electric utility including the new settlement type in the ANEC. 
(II) If a party other than the electric utility is propos- ing the inclusion of a new market settlement type, the filing shall be made sixty (60) days prior to the electric utility’s next periodic adjustment filing; 
B. The filing shall include, but is not be limited to: (I) Identification of the account affected by the change; (II) A description of the new settlement type demon- 
strating that it possesses the characteristics of, and is of the nature of a cost or revenue type allowed in the electric utility’s FAC by the commission in the preceding general rate case; and

(I) The filing shall be made within thirty (30) days of the electric utility’s filing. 
(II) The party requesting the inclusion of the new mar- ket settlement type shall bear the burden of proof to show that the new market settlement type possesses the characteristics of, and is of the nature of a cost or revenue type allowed in the elec- tric utility’s FAC by the commission in the preceding general rate case. 
(III) If a party challenges the inclusion of the market settlement type, the challenge will not delay the FAR filing schedule. 
(IV) If the challenge is upheld by the commission, the costs will be refunded or revenues returned along with interest in the next periodic adjustment; 
(G) The electric utility must be current on its submission of its surveillance monitoring reports; 
(H) Staff shall review the information filed and submitted by the electric utility in accordance with this rule and additional 
information obtained through discovery, if any, to determine if the proposed adjustment to the FARs is in accordance with the provisions of this rule, section 386.266, RSMo, and the FAC mechanism established, continued, or modified in the utility’s most recent general rate proceeding. Within thirty (30) days after the electric utility files its testimony and tariff sheets to adjust its FARs, the staff shall submit a recommendation regarding its examination and analysis to the commission; 
(I) OPC and other parties may file a response to the electric utility’s proposed FAR adjustment within forty (40) days after the electric utility files its testimony and tariff sheet(s) to adjust its FARs; 
(J) Within sixty (60) days after the electric utility files its testi- mony and tariff sheet(s) to adjust its FARs, the commission shall either— 
1. Issue an interim rate adjustment order approving the tar- iff sheets and the adjustments to the FARs; 
2. Allow the tariff sheets and the adjustments to the FARs to take effect without commission order; or 
3. If it determines the adjustment to the FARs is not in accordance with the provisions of this rule, section 386.266, RSMo, and the FAC mechanism established in the electric utili- ty’s most recent general rate proceeding, reject the proposed rate schedules, suspend the timeline of the FAR adjustment filing, set a prehearing date, and order the parties to propose a procedural schedule. The commission may order the electric utility to file tariff sheet(s) to implement interim adjusted FARs to reflect any part of the proposed adjustment that is not in question; 
(K) If the staff, OPC, or other party which receives, pursuant to 4 CSR 240-2.135, the information that the electric utility is required to submit and as ordered by the commission in a previ- ous proceeding, believes the information is insufficient to make a recommendation regarding the electric utility’s proposed FAR, it shall notify the electric utility within ten (10) business days of the electric utility’s filing of tariff sheets to adjust the FARs and iden- tify the information required and not submitted in compliance with that rule or order. The electric utility shall supply the infor- mation identified by the party, or shall notify the party that it believes the information provided was in compliance with the requirements of this rule and the commission’s most recent order establishing, continuing, or modifying the FAC, within ten (10) business days of the request. If the electric utility does not timely supply the information, the party asserting the failure to provide the required information must timely file a motion to compel with the commission. 
1. While the commission is considering the motion to com- pel, the processing timeline for the adjustment to increase the FARs shall be suspended. If the commission then issues an order requiring the information be provided, the time necessary for the information to be provided shall further extend the processing timeline for the adjustment to increase the FARs. If the commis- sion issues an order compelling discovery, interest will not be accrued by the utility from the time the commission receives a motion to compel until the time that the utility provides the requested information. For good cause shown the commission may further suspend this timeline. 
2. Except as provided herein, any delay in providing suffi- cient information in compliance with this rule and the commis- sion’s most recent order establishing, continuing, or modifying the FAC in a request to decrease the FARs shall not alter the pro- cessing timeline. 
[(5)](9) True-Ups of RAMs. [An electric utility that files for a RAM shall include in its tariff schedules and application, if filed in addition to tariff schedules, provision for true-ups on at least an annual basis which shall accurately and appropri- ately remedy any over-collection or under-collection through subsequent rate adjustments or refunds.] The purpose of a

(D) The staff shall examine and analyze the information filed and submitted by the electric utility pursuant to 4 CSR 240-3.161 and additional information obtained through discovery, to determine whether the true-up is in accordance with the provisions of this rule, section 386.266, RSMo and the RAM established in the electric [utility’s most recent general rate proceeding.] utility pur- suant to this rule and additional information obtained through discovery and as ordered by the commission, to determine whether the true-up amount is in accordance with the provisions of this rule, section 386.266, RSMo, and the RAM established in the electric utility’s most recent general rate proceeding. The staff shall submit a recommendation regarding its examination and analy- sis to the commission not later than thirty (30) days after the electric utility files [its tariff schedules for a true-up. The commission shall either issue an order deciding the true-up within sixty (60) days of the electric utility’s filing, suspend the timeline of the true-up in order to receive additional evidence and hold a hearing if needed or, if no such order is issued, the tariff schedules and the FAC rate adjustments shall take effect by operation of law sixty (60) days after the utility’s 
filing] for a true-up amount. [1. If the staff, OPC or other party which receives, pur- 
suant to a protective order, the information that the electric utility is required to submit in 4 CSR 240-3.161 and as ordered by the commission in a previous proceeding, believes the information that is required to be submitted pur- suant to 4 CSR 240-3.161 and the commission order estab- lishing the RAM has not been submitted or is insufficient to make a recommendation regarding the electric utility’s true- up filing, it shall notify the electric utility within ten (10) days of the electric utility’s filing and identify the information required. The electric utility shall supply the information identified by the party, or shall notify the party that it believes the information provided was responsive to the requirements, within ten (10) days of the request. If the elec- tric utility does not timely supply the information, the party asserting the failure to provide the required information must timely file a motion to compel with the commission. While the commission is considering the motion to compel the pro- cessing timeline for the adjustment to the FAC rates shall be suspended. If the commission then issues an order requiring the information to be provided, the time necessary for the information to be provided shall further extend the process- ing timeline. For good cause shown the commission may fur- ther suspend this timeline. 
2. If the party requesting the information can demon- strate to the commission that the adjustment shall result in a reduction in the FAC rates, the processing timeline shall continue with the best information available. When the elec- tric utility provides the necessary information, the RAM shall be adjusted again, if necessary, to reflect the additional information provided by the electric utility.] 
(E) OPC and other parties may file a response to the proposed true-up amount within forty (40) days of the electric utility true- up filing. 
(F) Within sixty (60) days of the electric utility’s true-up filing the commission shall issue an order— 
1. Allowing the tariff sheet(s) reflecting the true-up amount to take effect without commission order; or 
2. If it determines that the true-up amount reflected in the tariff sheet(s) is incorrect, rejecting the proposed tariff sheet(s) containing the true-up amount, suspending the timeline of the true-up filing, setting a prehearing date, and ordering the parties to propose a procedural schedule. The commission shall allow the electric utility to file tariff sheet(s) to implement interim FARs reflecting any part of the true-up amount that is not in question, and questions about the correctness of the true-up amount will not delay adjustments to FAR rates unrelated to the true-up. 
(G) If the staff, OPC or other party which receives, pursuant to 4 CSR 240-2.135, the information that the electric utility is required to submit and as ordered by the commission in a previ- ous proceeding, believes the information is insufficient to make a recommendation regarding the electric utility’s true-up filing, it shall notify the electric utility within ten (10) days of the electric utility’s filing and identify the information required. The electric utility shall supply the information identified by the party, or shall notify the party that it believes the information provided was responsive to the requirements, within ten (10) days of the request. If the electric utility does not timely supply the informa- tion, the party asserting the failure to provide the required infor- mation must timely file a motion to compel with the commission. 
1. While the commission is considering the motion to com- pel, the processing timeline for the determination of the true-up amount shall be suspended. If the commission then issues an order requiring the information to be provided, the time neces- sary for the information to be provided shall further extend the processing timeline. If the commission issues an order compelling discovery, interest will not be accrued by the utility from the time 
 
July 2, 2018 Vol. 43, No. 13 
 
Missouri Register 
Page 1435 

the commission receives a motion to compel until the time that the utility provides the requested information. For good cause shown the commission may further suspend this timeline. 
2. If the party requesting the information can demonstrate to the commission that the true-up amount shall result in a reduction in the FAR, the processing timeline shall continue with the best information available. When the electric utility provides the necessary information, the FAR shall be adjusted again, if necessary, to reflect the additional information provided by the electric utility. 
[(6)](10) Duration of RAMs and Requirement for General Rate Case. Once a RAM is approved by the commission, it shall remain in effect for a term of not more than four (4) years unless the com- mission earlier authorizes the modification, extension, or discontin- uance of the RAM in a general rate proceeding, although an electric utility may submit proposed rate schedules to implement periodic adjustments to its FAC rates between general rate proceedings. 
(A) If the commission approves a RAM for an electric utility, the electric utility must file a general rate case with the effective date of new rates to be no later than four (4) years after the effective date of the commission order implementing the RAM, assuming the maxi- mum statutory suspension of the rates so filed. 
1. The four- (4-)[-] year period shall not include any periods in which the electric utility is prohibited from collecting any charges under the [adjustment mechanism] RAM, or any period for which charges collected under the [adjustment mechanism] RAM must be fully refunded. In the event a court determines that the [adjustment mechanism] RAM is unlawful and all [moneys] monies collected are fully refunded as a result of such a decision, the electric utility shall be relieved of any obligation to file a general rate case. The term fully refunded as used in this section does not include amounts refunded as a result of reductions in fuel or purchased power costs minus fuel-related revenues or prudence adjustments. 
[(7)](11) Prudence Reviews Respecting RAMs. A prudence review of the costs subject to the RAM shall be conducted no less frequently than at eighteen- (18-)[-] month intervals. 
(A) All amounts ordered refunded by the commission shall include interest at the electric utility’s short-term borrowing rate. 
(B) The staff shall file notice within ten (10) days of starting its prudence review and shall submit a recommendation regarding its examination and analysis to the commission not later than one hun- dred eighty (180) days after [the staff initiates] initiating its pru- dence [audit] review. [The timing and frequency of prudence audits for each RAM shall be established in the general rate proceeding in which the RAM is established. The staff shall file notice within ten (10) days of starting its prudence audit. The commission shall issue an order not later than two hun- dred ten (210) days after the staff commences its prudence audit if no party to the proceeding in which the prudence audit is occurring files, within one hundred ninety (190) days of the staff’s commencement of its prudence audit, a request for a hearing.] Parties to the prudence review proceed- ing shall have ten (10) days after the staff files its recommenda- tion to request a hearing. The commission shall issue an order not later than thirty (30) days after the staff files its recommen- dation if no party requests a hearing. 
1. If the staff, OPC, or other party auditing the RAM believes that insufficient information has been supplied to make a recommen- dation regarding the prudence of the electric utility’s RAM, it may utilize discovery to obtain the information it seeks. If the electric util- ity does not timely supply the information, the party asserting the failure to provide the required information must timely file a motion to compel with the commission. While the commission is consider- ing the motion to compel the processing timeline shall be suspended. If the commission then issues an order requiring the information to be provided, the time necessary for the information to be provided 
shall further extend the processing timeline. For good cause shown the commission may further suspend this timeline. 
2. If the timeline is extended due to an electric utility’s failure to timely provide sufficient responses to discovery and a refund is due to the customers, the electric utility shall refund all imprudently incurred costs plus interest at the electric utility’s short-term borrow- ing rate. 
[(8)](12) Disclosure on Customers’ Bills. Any amounts charged under a [RAM approved by the] commission-approved RAM shall be separately disclosed on each customer’s bill. Proposed lan- guage regarding this disclosure shall be submitted to the commission for the commission’s approval in the general rate proceeding estab- lishing, modifying, or continuing the RAM. 
[(9)](13) Rate Design of the RAM. The design of the RAM rates shall reflect differences in losses incurred in the delivery of electricity at different voltage levels for the electric utility’s different rate classes[. Therefore, the electric utility shall conduct a] as determined through the periodic conduct of Missouri jurisdictional system loss studies. When the electric utility initially seeks authority to use a RAM, the end of the twelve- (12-) month period of actual data col- lected that is used in its Missouri jurisdictional system loss study within twenty-four (24) months [prior to the general rate proceed- ing in which it requests its initial RAM. The electric utility shall conduct a Missouri jurisdictional loss study no less often than every four (4) years thereafter, on a schedule that per- mits the study to be used in the general rate proceeding nec- essary for the electric utility to continue to utilize a RAM.] immediately preceding the date the utility files its general rate case requesting a RAM. When the electric utility seeks to continue or modify its RAM, the end of the twelve- (12-) month period of actual data collected that is used in its Missouri jurisdictional system loss study must be no earlier than two (2) years before the beginning of the twelve- (12-) month period the utility uses for developing the general rates it proposes the commission approve in that general rate proceeding. 
[(10) Submission of Surveillance Monitoring Reports. Each electric utility with an approved RAM shall submit to staff, OPC and parties approved by the commission a Surveillance Monitoring Report in the form and having the content provid- ed for by 4 CSR 240-3.161(6). 
(A) The Surveillance Monitoring Report shall be submitted within fifteen (15) days of the electric utility’s next sched- uled United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) 10-Q or 10-K filing with the initial submission within fifteen (15) days of the electric utility’s next scheduled SEC 10-Q or 10-K filing following the effective date of the com- mission order establishing the RAM. 
(B) If the electric utility also has an approved environmen- tal cost recovery mechanism, the electric utility must submit a single Surveillance Monitoring Report for both the environ- mental cost recovery mechanism and the RAM. 
(C) Upon a finding that a utility has knowingly or reckless- ly provided materially false or inaccurate information to the commission regarding the surveillance data prescribed in 4 CSR 240-3.161(6), after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, the commission may suspend a fuel adjustment mechanism or order other appropriate remedies as provided by law.] 
[(11)](14) Incentive Mechanism or Performance-Based Program. During a general rate proceeding in which an electric utility has pro- posed establishment or modification of a RAM, or in which a RAM may be allowed to continue in effect, any party may propose for the commission’s consideration incentive mechanisms or performance- based programs to improve the efficiency and cost effectiveness of 

Page 1436 
Proposed Rules 
July 2, 2018 Vol. 43, No. 13 
the electric utility’s fuel and purchased power procurement activities and/or off-system sales activities. 
(A) The incentive mechanisms or performance-based programs may or may not include some or all components of [fuel and pur- chased power costs] base energy costs, designed to provide the electric utility with incentives to improve the efficiency and cost- effectiveness of its fuel and purchased power procurement activities and/or off-system sales. 
(B) Any incentive mechanism or performance-based program shall be structured to align the interests of the electric utility’s customers and shareholders. The anticipated benefits to the electric utility’s customers from the incentive or performance-based program shall equal or exceed the anticipated costs of the mechanism or program to the electric utility’s customers. [For this purpose,] Customer rates shall include the cost of an incentive mechanism or perfor- mance-based program [shall include any increase in expense or reduction in revenue credit that increases rates to cus- tomers] in any time period above what they would be without the incentive mechanism or performance-based program. 
(C) If the commission approves an incentive mechanism or perfor- mance-based program, such incentive mechanism or performance- based program shall be binding on the commission for the entire term of the incentive mechanism or performance-based program. If the commission approves an incentive mechanism or performance- based program, such incentive mechanism or performance based program shall be binding on the electric utility for the entire term of the incentive mechanism or performance-based program unless oth- erwise ordered or conditioned by the commission. 
[(12)](15) Pre-Existing Adjustment Mechanisms, Tariffs, and Regulatory Plans. The provisions of this rule shall not affect[:]— 
(A) Any adjustment mechanism, [rate schedule,] tariff, incentive plan, or other ratemaking mechanism that was approved by the com- mission and in effect prior to the effective date of this rule; and 
(B) Any experimental regulatory plan that was approved by the commission and in effect prior to the effective date of this rule. 
[(13)](16) Nothing in this rule shall preclude a complaint case from being filed, as provided by law[, on the grounds that a utility is earning more than a fair return on equity, nor shall an electric utility be permitted to use the existences of its RAM as a defense to a complaint case based upon an allegation that it is earning more than a fair return on equity]. If a complaint is filed on the grounds that [a utility is earning more than a fair return on equity,] an electric utility is acting in violation of its approved RAM tariff sheets or on the grounds that its rates have become unjust and unreasonable, the commission shall issue a pro- cedural schedule that includes a clear delineation of the case timeline no later than sixty (60) days from the date the complaint is filed. 
[(14) Rule Review. The commission shall review the effec- tiveness of this rule by no later than December 31, 2010, and may, if it deems necessary, initiate rulemaking proceed- ings to revise this rule.] 
(17) Party status and party rights in RAM proceedings subse- quent to the last general rate case where the commission estab- lishes, continues, or modifies the electric utility’s RAM. 
(A) Each party to the most recent general rate proceeding in which the commission established, continued, or modified the electric utility’s RAM shall be a party to each subsequent related RAM rate adjustment proceeding, RAM true-up proceeding, and RAM prudence review proceeding, without applying to the commission for intervention, and shall be provided the periodic reports and surveillance monitoring reports required by this rule during the period of time when they are entitled to be a party to such proceedings without applying for intervention. In any sub- sequent general rate proceeding, such person or entity must seek 
and be granted status as an intervenor to be a party to that case and to consequently be a party, without seeking and being grant- ed status as an intervenor to RAM-related proceedings initiated after that case. 
(B) Anyone may seek to intervene, pursuant to 4 CSR 240- 2.075, in any RAM rate adjustment proceeding, RAM true-up proceeding, RAM prudence review proceeding, or general rate proceeding to modify, continue, or discontinue a RAM. If no party objects to the intervention request within ten (10) days of when it is filed, then the applicant for intervention shall be deemed to have been granted intervention without a specific com- mission order, unless within the above-referenced ten- (10-) day period the commission denies the application for intervention on its own motion. If an objection to the application for intervention is filed on or before the end of the above-referenced ten- (10-) day period, the commission shall rule on the application and the objection within ten (10) days of the filing of the objection. 
(18) Discovery. Each discovery response that a party obtains in general rate proceedings where the commission approves, modi- fies, rejects, continues, or discontinues a RAM and in related subsequent RAM rate adjustment proceedings, RAM true-up proceedings, and RAM prudence review proceedings may be offered as evidence in any subsequent RAM rate adjustment pro- ceeding, RAM true-up proceeding, RAM prudence review pro- ceeding, or general rate proceeding to modify, continue, or dis- continue its RAM as if the response were made to a discovery request in that proceeding without requiring the party who made the request to resubmit the same discovery request (data request, interrogatory, request for production, request for admission, or deposition), subject to commission ruling on any evidentiary objection(s). Unless the commission orders otherwise, sua sponte or on a party’s motion, the discovery response shall have the same protection it was last afforded, by rule or by commission order. 
(19) Supplementing and updating discovery responses in subse- quent related proceedings. A party who provided a discovery response in a prior case as described in section (18) shall be under no obligation to supplement or update that response in a subsequent proceeding, unless the requesting party issues a dis- covery request in the subsequent case which clearly identifies the particular discovery requests to be supplemented or updated and the particular period to be covered by the updated response. A party responding to a request to supplement or update a prior proceeding discovery response shall supplement or update the discovery response where the responding party has learned or subsequently learns its response is in some material respect insuf- ficiently detailed or incorrect. 
(20) The commission shall establish a new case for each general rate proceeding, RAM rate adjustment proceeding, RAM true- up proceeding, and RAM prudence review proceeding. 
(21) Right to Discovery Unaffected. In addressing certain discov- ery matters and the provision of certain information by electric utilities, this rule is not intended to restrict the discovery rights of any party. 
[(15)](22) Waiver of Provisions of this Rule. Provisions of this rule may be waived by the commission for good cause shown after an opportunity for a hearing.

Title 10—DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES Division 70—Soil and Water Districts Commission Chapter 2—Referendums 
PROPOSED AMENDMENT 
10 CSR 70-2.010 Conduct of Referendums. The commission is amending sections (1), (2), (4), (6), and (7); deleting section (5) and renumbering sections (6) and (7). Proposed amendments will delete or update obsolete rule language in sections (1) and (7); delete lan- guage that is duplicative with state statutes in sections (1) and (2); delete applicable rule requirements and procedures in sections (4), (5), and (7) and move to commission policy (District Operations Manual) and delete and replace restrictive words in sections (1), (2), (4), (5), and (7). 
PURPOSE: This rule is being amended because it has not been revised since 1955 and is not current with state statutes or commis- sion policy. The proposed amendments to 10 CSR 70-2.010 were iden- tified during the Red Tape Reduction review pursuant to Executive Order 17-03. 
(1) The process for the local committee and election judges [shall] is— 
(A) Publish successive notices of the referendum [and selection of supervisors] in one (1) or more newspapers in the county where the referendum is being held during each of the two (2) weeks imme- diately preceding the referendum; 
(B) [Provide sealed ballot boxes and o]Open polls promptly at the time advertised; 
(C) Furnish official ballots to each polling place; and 
(D) Close the polls promptly at the closing hour designated but allow those who have entered the polling place before this time to complete their ballots. 
(2) [Three (3) official election judges are required for each polling place. They must be residents and landowners within 
the proposed district.] If any elected judge is not present at the polls on the date and time of the referendum, [those] the judges pre- sent may select any citizen [of] in the [proposed] district to serve in [his/her] their place and [give him/her] provide the necessary instructions. [All instructions to judges must make clear that any person designated to conduct a referendum or assist in a referendum and who thereby gains knowledge as to how any land representative voted and reveals knowledge to any other person shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.] 
(3) Only one (1) vote is allowed per farm [either] by the owner or [his/her] their legal representative. A tract of land must be operated as an independent farm enterprise to entitle its land representative to a single vote. Two (2) or more tracts of land that are operated by one (1) management entity as an independent farm enterprise will be entitled to one (1) vote. [The size of each farm must be at least three (3) acres or more.] 
(4) Each farm owner may personally cast as many votes in the soil district referendum [and election of supervisors] as [s/he] they own[s] independently operated farms. If [it is impossible for] the landowner is unable to personally cast [his/her] their eligible vote(s) [because of absentee landownership, sickness or for any other reason over which s/he has no control, the soil dis- tricts law provides that s/he], they may give a power of attorney to a taxpayer residing within the county to represent [him/her] them in [this] the referendum [and election of supervisors. It is the policy of the commission to require that this taxpayer not be a legal land representative for more than one (1) landowner, unless legal representation has been established previously by reason of professional or paid farm managership]. 
[(5) Immediately after closing the polls, the judges shall open the ballot boxes and carefully count the ballots cast. They shall tally on the tally sheet provided for the referendum, the number of “Yes” votes and the number of “No” votes and on the tally sheet provided for the election of supervisors write plainly the names of the nominees in the proper spaces and tally the votes each receives on the lines just below the name. The nominee who receives the largest number of votes will be declared elected a supervisor provided the State Soil and Water Districts Commission finds that the vote constituted a substantial expression of opinion.] 
[(6)](5) All blanks on the [“L]list of [V]voters[”] and all [“R]refer- endum[”] and [“E]election[”] tally sheets must be correctly filled in. 
[(7)](6) [After the ballots have been counted, they shall be sealed in a package by the judges at the polls and shall not be inspected except in the case of a contested election and then only on order of the proper court. Arrangements should be made to return ballot boxes, “Listing” sheets, “]Referendum[”] and [“E]election[”] tally sheets and all supplies should be returned to the clerk of the county court within twenty- four (24) hours after polls are closed, where they shall be safely pre- served for twelve (12) months. In case arrangements cannot be made with the county clerk, all these materials shall be sent to the chair[man] of the [State] Soil and Water Districts Commission. The chair[man] of the local committee and the clerk of the county court shall certify the total referendum vote by area[s] and polling place[s and the total election votes by areas for each nominee] and report the[ir] results to the [director] chair of the Soil and Water Districts Commission.

(1) General Availability of Funds. State cost-share funds [shall be] are available only to landowners [of land] located in soil and water conservation districts which have agreed to locally administer the program and have executed a Memorandum of Understanding with the commission setting forth the terms of assistance. To be eligible, a landowner must have a conservation plan as approved by the district. 
(2) Annual [Apportionment] Allocation of Funds. All funds [apportioned] allocated to the cost-share program for any fiscal year shall be apportioned by the commission to the participating dis- tricts by considering the character of the districts’ soil and water conservation needs according to criteria developed by the commis- sion.

(C) Termination of the Memorandum of Understanding. In the event that the Memorandum of Understanding required by section (1) is terminated by any district or by the commis- sion, the district shall release all funds unobligated as of the effective date of termination and shall further release, as they become available, obligated funds for which no claim for payment is made in a timely manner. 
(D) Use of Released Funds. Funds released by any district in accordance with subsections (2)(A)–(C) shall be returned to the Cost- Share Program to be reallocated by the commis- sion considering the relative need basis or reserved by the commission for special allotment under subsection (2)(E).]

Title 10—DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES Division 70—Soil and Water Districts Commission Chapter 5—State Funded Cost-Share Program 
PROPOSED AMENDMENT 
10 CSR 70-5.020 Application and Eligibility for Funds. The com- mission is amending sections (1) through (9). Proposed amendments will delete or update obsolete rule language in sections (1) through (9); delete applicable rule requirements and procedures in section (2) and move to commission policy (Cost-Share Handbook); and delete and replace restrictive words in sections (1), (2), (3), (5), (6), (7), (8), and (9), and delete the forms following the rule. 
PURPOSE: This rule is being amended because it has not been revised since 1999 and is not current with state statutes or commis- sion policy. The proposed amendments to 10 CSR 70-5.020 were identified during the Red Tape Reduction review pursuant to Executive Order 17-03. 
(1) Establishing Practice Eligibility. The commission [shall] estab- lishes a list of eligible practices for which cost-share funds [should be utilized] are available and [annually shall] affirms or modif[y]ies the list as it considers appropriate. The participating dis- tricts shall develop annual priority listings of preferred practices from the commission eligibility list upon which they will base their con- siderations for cost-sharing. Landowners [shall be] are eligible for cost-share funds [only] for only the [types of] practices designated as eligible [for these purposes] by both the Soil and Water Districts Commission and [by] the participating districts. No eligible practices are available to treat flood scouring problems. 
(2) Application for Assistance. To be eligible for assistance from the Cost-Share Program, a landowner must make application on forms provided by the commission. Copies of these forms [shall be] are available at district offices. The district’s board will act upon only those applications for cost-sharing from landowners who have a con- servation plan as approved by the district[, except as provided in sections (7) and (8), and] for eligible practices on which construc- tion or implementation has not yet begun. [In commission-approved Special Area Land Treatment (SALT) program projects, the dis- trict board of supervisors may approve SALT cost-share appli- cations at the date of the conservation plan approval or at the approval date of the SALT project, whichever is later.] However, governmental agencies, political subdivisions, and public institutions 
 
July 2, 2018 Vol. 43, No. 13 
 
Missouri Register 
Page 1443 

are excluded from participation in the Cost-Share Program. [As a further stipulation for receiving cost-sharing assistance, the land upon which the practice is to be implemented or con- structed must be eroding at rates greater than tolerable soil loss limits or be experiencing active gully erosion, except that cost-sharing assistance also may be available in the fol- lowing instances when excessive erosion is not necessarily occurring:] 
[(A) For eligible practices to prevent gully erosion when needed to complete a water disposal system; 
(B) For the establishment of permanent forest cover on mar- ginal or riparian lands; 
(C) For the exclusion of domestic livestock grazing from existing woodlands on marginal or riparian soils; 
(D) For a no-till practice for forage conversions; 
(E) For grade stabilization structures that are greater than ten (10) years old when the principal pipe has failed; 
(F) For a no-till practice to improve the vegetative cover of pasture and rangeland to provide continued erosion preven- tion; and 
(G) For a practice to demonstrate benefits of a planned grazing system.] 
(3) Funding Determination and Limits. It [shall be] is the responsi- bility and duty of the board of supervisors to determine the actual dollar amount of cost-sharing on individual applications. [State cost-share rates shall not exceed the limits established in 10 CSR 70-5.040(1).] In the event that the landowner wishes to con- struct or implement practices over and above the size or scope deter- mined by a qualified technician to be of minimum and necessary need for soil and water conservation, the board shall provide cost-share assistance on only that part of the practice necessary for soil and water conservation purposes. 
(4) Availability of Federal Funds. [Applications for cost-sharing assistance may be approved by the district board of supervi- sors when it determines that federal funds are unavailable to that applicant for the proposed practice.] State cost-sharing assistance [also ]is available for practice units applied for but not approved by the federal program, if those additional units constitute a complete structure, conservation measure, or operation in and of themselves. State cost-sharing assistance may supplement federal cost-sharing on an individual practice, [within limits set forth in section (3),] and only upon practice components cost-shared by the federal program[, when the estimated cost-share portion of the practice exceeds the national program allowable dollar figure from the federal program. Special area land treatment project areas approved by the commission are exempt from the provisions of this rule]. 
(5) Compliance with Applicable Law. In the installation of any eligi- ble practices, the landowner [solely shall be] is responsible for assuring compliance with any applicable federal, state, or local laws, ordinances, and regulations. The landowner is also [is solely] responsible for obtaining all permits, licenses or other instruments of permission required before the installation of the proposed practice. 
(6) Group Projects. Landowners may cooperate with other landown- ers in the event that the most appropriate solution to the soil and water conservation needs addressed [in the Act] requires eligible practices to be located on or across property lines of different landowners. In these cases, an agreement between or among cooper- ating landowners must be prepared by or on behalf of the group stip- ulating and providing for, but not limited to, the divisions of unshared costs, maintenance, such easements as necessary to accomplish the installation, operation, and maintenance of the practice and the shar- ing of rights and benefits over and above the public benefits which might accrue from the installation of the practice. This agreement 
and an [group] area conservation plan [shall] may be submitted to the district(s) within which the land included in the plans lies. Upon approval of the [group] area conservation plan by the district(s), the individual landowners are eligible to apply for cost-sharing assistance under this rule. The [group] area conservation plan may serve in lieu of the individual landowner conservation plans [as stipulated in section (2)]. All other requirements for application and cost- sharing assistance remain in effect. 
(7) Special Projects. Upon notification [to a district(s)] of [a fund availability] available funds for special critical-needs projects [so] designated by the commission, the district board shall make all rea- sonable efforts to contact landowners [of land] within the special project area [which lies within the district boundaries,] to inform them [landowners] of the [availability of the] available [special] cost-share funds and to encourage the landowners to coop- erate in the special critical-needs projects. [Each l]Landowners with- in the project boundaries [shall then be eligible to] may apply for the special cost-shar[ing]e assistance on practices specified as eligi- ble by the commission [in its project plan]. [Application shall be made at the local district office in the manner of application for general state cost- sharing assistance to landowners, but action on applications by the board as set forth in 10 CSR 70-5.050(2) shall not be taken unless applications from landowners covering seventy-five percent (75%) of the land to be treated are made. In special critical-needs project coop- eration, the landowner requirement of a conservation plan as approved by the district, under section (2), is waived. All other landowner requirements and obligations here named shall remain in effect.] Cooperation in these special projects is entirely voluntary [on the part of the] for landowners. 
(8) Termination Date. All applications shall specify a termination date [which shall not exceed twelve (12) months from the date the landowner’s application is approved by the board. In commission-approved SALT projects, the district board of supervisors may set the termination date to be anytime dur- ing the lifetime of the SALT project] for completion of the con- servation practice. Claims for payment received after the termina- tion date shall not be honored unless an amendment for an extension is approved by the board. Amendments for extensions can be autho- rized for an adequate period of time determined by the board to be reasonable and fair to the landowner. [An amendment for an extension must be approved prior to the termination date of the original application and only when the implementation or construction has begun on the practice.] 
(9) Application Amendments. A copy of [any] amendments will be furnished to each party receiving a copy of the original application and the board shall approve each amendment before it [shall] becomes effective. [An amendment to a cost-share application shall not be appropriate in the event that the construction or implementation of a practice has begun, except as provided in subsections (10)(A), (C) and (F). An amendment to an application for cost-sharing assistance shall be appropriate for any of the following reasons:] The commission will provide guidance regarding appropriate reasons for amendments. 
[(A) To increase the quantities of eligible components need- ed on the practice;

As a condition for receiving any cost-share funds for eligible practices, the landowner, before submission of a claim for reimbursement, shall enter into an agreement of maintenance on forms sup- plied by the commission. The provisions of the agreement shall state; if the practice is removed, altered or modified so as to lessen its effectiveness, without prior approval of the district, for a period of ten (10) years or the expected life span of the practice, whichever is the lesser, after the date of receiving payment, the landowner or his/her heirs, assignees or other transferees, shall refund to the Cost-Share Program the prorated amount of the state cost-share payment previ- ously received for the practice or portion of the practice which has been removed, altered or modified; and that if the district assumes maintenance responsibilities, right of access will be granted by the landowner. A copy of the agree- ment shall be recorded by the commission in the county where the land upon which the practices are constructed is located if the commission concurs with a board’s determina- tion that there is a need for recording.]

PROPOSED AMENDMENT 
10 CSR 70-5.060 Commission Administration of the Cost-Share Program. The commission is amending sections (1), (2), (4), (5), and (7); deleting sections (3) and (6); adding a new section (4) and renumbering sections (4), (5), (6), and (7) that follow the new sec- tion (4). Proposed amendments will delete or update obsolete rule language in sections (1), (2), (4), and (5) and delete and replace restrictive words in sections (1), (2), (4), (5), and (7). 
PURPOSE: This rule is being amended because it has not been revised since 1996 and is not current with state statutes or commis- sion policy. The proposed amendments to 10 CSR 70-5.060 were identified during the Red Tape Reduction review pursuant to Executive Order 17-03. 
(1) Forms. The commission shall [prepare] develop and make avail- able to participating districts, [sufficient copies of all] forms nec- essary for district administration, and [shall] further prepare and keep updated [a handbook] guidance for district use in assisting in the administration of the Cost-Share Program. 
(2) Commission Review of Claims for Payment.

[(3) Payment to Landowner and Recording Agreement. Upon receipt of the warrant from the Office of Administration, the commission shall transmit the same by mail to the landown- er. The district shall be notified monthly of any transmission at which time the commission shall complete all necessary portions of the cost-sharing assistance agreement prepared by the landowner at the time the claim for payment was pre- pared. Costs incurred in the recording and indexing of the agreements shall be paid by the commission.] 
(3) Variance Requests. The commission may grant individual variances upon presentation of adequate proof that compliance with sections 278.060 to 278.300, RSMo or any rule or regula- tion, standard, requirement, limitation, or order of the commis- sion will have an arbitrary and unreasonable impact on landown- ers participating in soil and water conservation eligible practices. In determining under what conditions and to what extent a vari- ance may be granted, the commission has wide discretion in weighing the equities involved as well as the advantages and dis- advantages of approving or disapproving a variance request. 
(A) The variance request shall— 1. Be in writing; 2. Be filed with the program director of the Soil and Water 
Conservation Program; and 3. Specify the reasons a variance should be granted by the 
commission. (B) The burden is placed on the applicant of a variance to show 
the inequities if the variance is not granted. (C) The program director shall promptly investigate the appli- 
cation and make a recommendation to the commission as to whether the variance should be granted or denied. 
(4) Incomplete or Inaccurate Claims for Payments. [If, in reviewing the claim for payment, the commission or its agent deter- mines that the information contained in the claim is incom- plete or inaccurate, that an error exists in the final computa- tions or that proper documentation has not been supplied, it shall notify the district of the deficiency. The district then shall request the landowner to complete a claim for payment and if necessary a new cost-sharing assistance agreement required by 10 CSR 70-5.030(5).] No payment will be autho- rized until the commission has determined that the claim for payment and necessary supporting documentations are complete and accurate [in all respects. Cost- sharing assistance agreements shall not be recorded until the payment in fact has been autho- rized by the commission and received by the landowner]. 
(5) Violations of Cost-Sharing Assistance Agreement. In the event the commission is notified of an alleged violation of the cost-sharing assistance agreement, a representative of the commission, or a repre- sentative of the district, or both, shall investigate the alleged viola- tion and report the results of the investigation to the commission. If, following the investigation, it appears as though a violation has occurred, the district board of supervisors shall notify the landowner by certified mail, return receipt requested, and [shall] make demand for repayment of the appropriate amount to the state Cost-Share Program within thirty (30) days after receipt of the demand for repay- ment. Within that thirty- (30-)[-] day period, the landowner may request the commission review the demand for repayment. The request for a review must be in writing. The review shall be conduct- ed at a regularly scheduled commission meeting, allowing adequate opportunity for the landowner to present arguments in support of the claim. The landowner’s arguments may be presented by the landown- er, by a representative, or in writing. If, following the review, the commission determines that no violation has occurred or that exten- uating circumstances justify the landowner’s position, the demand for repayment shall be withdrawn and the commission shall [so] notify the landowner of its decision. If, however, following the review, the commission determines the violation did occur, it shall [so] notify the landowner by certified mail, return receipt requested, and [shall] renew the demand for repayment. If the repayment is not received within thirty (30) days of receipt of the commission’s request for repayment or if all deficiencies are not corrected at the landowner’s expense within the time specified[,] by the commission, the commis- sion may refer the matter to the Office of the Attorney General for recovery of the state cost-share funds. 
[(6) Report to Districts. The commission shall prepare on a monthly basis a report to each participating district indicat- ing the payments which have been made from the Cost- Share Program during the preceding month and any other information determined by the commission to be of value to the districts regarding the administration of the program.] 
[(7)](6) New Practices. The commission [shall have] has the author- ity to conduct a pilot project for the purpose of testing development and implementation of new cost-share practices appropriate for future soil and water conservation resource needs. A pilot project will be conducted for a specified period of time in a limited area determined by the commission.

(1) Before being admitted to the examination, an applicant for licen- sure as a professional engineer shall have the knowledge, skills, and experience as the board deems necessary to qualify the applicant for being placed in responsible charge of engineering work. The mini- mum length of experience required of the applicant, based on educa- tion, is three (3) years for any applicant holding a master’s degree in engineering; however, an applicant will not be admitted to the exam- ination sooner than four (4) years after the applicant has satisfied the educational requirements of sections 327.221 and 327.241, RSMo, provided, however, any applicant [who shall have been] conferred 
with a master’s degree in engineering concurrently while acquiring three (3) years of satisfactory engineering experience, as provided in this rule, [shall be admitted] qualifies for admission to the exam- ination. The Engineers’ Council for Professional Development (ECPD) has been succeeded by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, Inc. (ABET). For purposes of evaluat- ing engineering curricula at the baccalaureate level, the programs accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission (EAC) of ABET shall be the basis used for evaluation of programs not accred- ited by EAC of ABET. 
(3) Foreign-educated applicants holding an engineering degree not accredited by ECPD, ABET, or its successor organizations will be required to submit a favorable evaluation report completed by an evaluation service acceptable by the professional engineering division of the board certifying equivalency to an ABET accredited degree. Applicants holding a United States of America (U[.]S[.]A[.]) engi- neering degree not accredited by ECPD, ABET, or its successor organizations will be required to have their educational degree pro- gram evaluated in order to determine whether or not it is equal to or exceeds the programs accredited by ECPD, ABET, or their successor organizations. The evaluation must be completed by an [engineer(s) experienced in evaluating academic credentials selected by the professional engineering division or by an] evaluation ser- vice acceptable by the professional engineering division of the board. The evaluator, by evaluation of transcripts and an official publication describing the engineering degree program of the institution, person- al interview, by examination, or both in any other manner deemed suitable, shall make an evaluation as to whether the academic pro- gram completed by the applicant meets the minimum educational requirements established by section 327.221, RSMo. The evaluator shall recommend to the professional engineering division and report how any deficiencies can be corrected, listing prescribed educational areas to bring the applicant’s academic qualifications up to the required minimum.

Nonpersonal contact activities include correspondence courses, video and televised cours- es, Internet and email courses, or other activities where the presenter is not in physical proximity to the attendee. 
(2) The following are exceptions to the requirement that licensees successfully complete twenty (20) PDUs prior to renewal: 
(A) The licensee can show good cause why he/she was unable to complete the PDU requirements. In the event good cause is shown, the licensee will be [required] allowed to make up all outstanding required PDUs within a reasonable amount of time as established by the board; 
(B) A professional land surveyor who holds licensure in Missouri for less than twelve (12) months from the date of his/her initial licen- sure, [shall not be required to] need not report PDUs at the first license renewal; or 
(4) In evaluating PDUs for licensure renewal, the board will be guid- ed by the following standards and guidelines: 
(B) Except as otherwise stated in this rule, licensees [shall] will earn one (1) PDU for every fifty (50) to sixty (60) minutes of activity that qualifies as acceptable PDU credit pursuant to this rule. 
(C) Activities. 1. PDU activities must be relevant to the practice of land sur- 
veying and may include technical, ethical, or business related con- tent. 
2. PDUs may be earned at locations outside Missouri, so long as the activity qualifies as acceptable PDU credit pursuant to this rule. 
3. Assuming they otherwise qualify as acceptable PDU credit pursuant to this rule, the following activities are acceptable sources of PDU credits: 
A. Successful completion of college or university course earns thirty (30) PDUs per semester hour and twenty (20) PDUs per quarter hour. Auditing or “hearing” a course qualifies for one-third (1/3) PDU credit of that stated herein; 
B. Active participation and successful completion of semi- nars, tutorials, workshops, short courses, correspondence courses, or televised or videotaped courses. Attending program presentations at 
related technical or professional meetings. A correspondence course must require the participant to show evidence of achievement with a final graded test; 
C. Authoring a paper or article earns five (5) PDUs upon actual publication in a regionally or nationally circulated technical journal or trade magazine. Credit cannot be claimed until that article or paper is actually published. [Licensees shall not earn more than ten (10) PDUs per two- (2-) year renewal period for authoring a paper or article] PDUs earned for authoring a paper or article are limited to ten (10) PDUs per two- (2-) year renewal period; 
D. Teaching or instructing a course or seminar that satisfies the PDU criteria described in this rule, or making a presentation at a technical meeting or convention. For the original instruction or presentation, a licensee [shall] earns two (2) PDUs for each PDU a participant could earn pursuant to this rule. 
E. Notwithstanding the provisions above, PDUs will only be awarded for the first occurrence of attending or teaching a qualifying course or seminar per every two- (2-) year renewal period. 
(7) The board will review all PDUs claimed in support of a renewal application. If audited and it is determined that a portion of the claimed PDUs fail to meet PDU requirements, the licensee will be notified in writing of the denied PDUs. The licensee [shall] will have three (3) months from the license renewal date in which to substan- tiate the original claim or to earn other credits to meet the minimum requirements. If PDUs are denied to the extent that the licensee has failed to obtain the required number of PDUs for renewal, then the board will deny issuance of the renewal.

20 CSR 2030-21.010 Design of Fire Suppression Systems. The board is amending the purpose statement and all sections of the rule and adding new section (4). 
PURPOSE: This rule is being amended to define a qualified profes- sional engineer and to provide clarity of the qualified professional engineer’s responsibility regarding the design of fire suppression sys- tems. 
PURPOSE: This rule requires [the design of] fire suppression sys- tems to be designed[, prepared,] and sealed by, or under the imme- diate personal supervision of, a qualified professional engineer. 
(1) Pursuant to section 327.181, RSMo, the design of fire suppres- sion systems is engineering and therefore the plans for those systems must be designed[, prepared,] and sealed by, or under the imme- diate personal supervision of, a qualified professional engineer. This can be accomplished by either of two (2) ways: 
(A) [The design] A qualified professional engineer seals [the] construction documents that specify the design and performance cri- teria for the fire suppression system, including sprinklers, fire alarm[s, and other suppression] systems, and other fire suppres- sion systems. The layout and sizing of these systems[,] may be done by a Level III Technician certified by the National Institute for Certification in Engineering Technologies (NICET) [or a profes- sional engineer, can]. The resulting plans may be submitted to the qualified professional engineer as [a] shop drawings. [These shop drawings may be sealed by a professional engineer.] The [design] qualified professional engineer issuing construction documents specifying design and performance criteria must review and approve the submitted shop drawings for compliance with the design and specifications shown on the construction docu- ments; [and] or 
(B) [If there is no design engineer for the fire suppression system, then the shop drawings] The plans for the sprinklers, fire alarm[s] systems, and other fire suppression systems must be designed and [prepared] sealed by, or under the immediate personal supervision of, a qualified professional engineer. [These shop drawings must be sealed by the professional engineer who prepared them.] 
(2) Nothing in this section [shall] prohibits the [design] qualified professional engineer issuing construction documents specifying design and performance criteria, at his/her discretion, to specify and require [the] submitted shop drawings to be designed[, pre- pared,] and sealed, by, or under the immediate personal supervi- sion of, a qualified professional engineer. 
(3) The design of fire suppression systems for dwelling units as defined in the National Fire Protection Association’s Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems (NFPA 13D) is exempt and is not required to be designed by a qualified professional engineer so long as the layout and sizing of these systems are done by a Level III Technician certified in the Fire Suppression System Layout by the NICET. Engineering decisions needed when the scope of the project is not clearly addressed in NFPA 13D shall be done by a qualified professional engineer. 
(4) The term “qualified professional engineer” used in 20 CSR 2030–21.010 means a professional engineer, as defined under sec- tion 327.181, RSMo, who has specific sprinkler, fire alarm sys- tem, or other fire suppression system education, training, and experience, as determined by the board, necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public. 
AUTHORITY: section 327.041, RSMo [Supp. 2008] 2016. This rule originally filed as 4 CSR 30-21.010. Original rule filed May 13, 2005, effective Nov. 30, 2005. Moved to 20 CSR 2030-21.010, effec-
