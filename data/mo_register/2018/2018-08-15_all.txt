Emergency Rules 
MISSOURI REGISTER 

Rules appearing under this heading are filed under the authority granted by section 536.025, RSMo 2000. An emergency rule may be adopted by an agency if the agency finds that an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare, or a compelling governmental interest requires emergency action; follows procedures best calculated to assure fairness to all interested persons and parties under the circumstances; follows procedures which comply with the protections extended by the Missouri and the United States Constitutions; limits the scope of such rule to the circum- stances creating an emergency and requiring emergency procedure, and at the time of or prior to the adoption of such rule files with the secretary of state the text of the rule togeth- er with the specific facts, reasons, and findings which support its conclusion that there is an immediate danger to the public health, safety, or welfare which can be met only through the adoption of such rule and its reasons for concluding that the procedure employed is fair to all interested persons and par- ties under the circumstances. 
Rules filed as emergency rules may be effective not less than ten (10) days after filing or at such later date as may be specified in the rule and may be terminated at any time by the state agency by filing an order with the secretary of state fixing the date of such termination, which order shall be published by the secretary of state in the Missouri Register as soon as practicable. 
All emergency rules must state the period during which they are in effect, and in no case can they be in effect more than one hundred eighty (180) calendar days or thirty (30) legislative days, whichever period is longer. Emergency rules are not renewable, although an agency may at any time adopt an identical rule under the normal rulemaking proce- dures. 
Title 13—DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES Division 10—Division of Finance and Administrative Services Chapter 4—Abortions 
EMERGENCY RULE 
13 CSR 10-4.010 Prohibition Against Expenditure of Appropriated Funds for Abortion Facilities 
PURPOSE: This rule supplements the requirements of HB 2011, passed by the 99th General Assembly, effective for State Fiscal Year 2019 and prescribes requirements for the Department of Social Services, individuals, organizations, or other entities receiving fund- ing or appropriated funds from the General Assembly. 
EMERGENCY STATEMENT: House Bill 2011, 99th General Assembly, Second Regular Session (“HB 2011”), contains the Department of Social Services’ (department) authority to spend funds for state fiscal year 2019. State fiscal year 2019 begins and HB 2011 took effect July 1, 2018. Sections 11.715 and 11.800 of HB 2011 pro- hibit the department from expending any funds to abortion facilities or affiliates or associates thereof. HB 2011 does not define “affiliate or associates thereof,” “program,” or other phrases and they must be defined in order for the department to timely and effectively imple- ment HB 2011. Additionally, the terms and phrases must be defined to give notice to entities that receive funds from the department for providing services. Some entities that received funds in state fiscal 
year 2018 may not be eligible to receive funds in state fiscal year 2019. The definitions must be in effect as soon as possible after July 1, 2018, to ensure that those parties do not provide services for which they are not eligible to receive payment from the department. The def- initions must also be in effect to ensure that the department does not expend funds in violation of Article IV, Section 28 of the Missouri Constitution. The regular rulemaking process takes several months, and state fiscal year 2019 would be more than half over by the time regular rules would take effect. In the interim, for several months the department’s ability to expend funds for a variety of health and wel- fare services could be impaired. Impairment of the ability to expend funds for health and welfare services could compromise the depart- ment’s ability to protect the public health and welfare. The depart- ment finds that this emergency rule is necessary to preserve a com- pelling governmental interest of prohibiting the expenditure of appro- priated funds for programs that perform abortions or that counsel women to have an abortion, or for abortion facilities as mandated by HB 2011. As expressed in the laws of the state of Missouri, the state has a compelling governmental interest to ensure that government funds are not expended in support of counseling women to have abor- tions, or to pay for abortions, unless an exception otherwise exists under federal law. The promulgation and implementation of this emergency rule is necessary to comply with the provisions of Art IV, Section 28 of the Missouri Constitution. An early effective date is required because this emergency amendment provides for the imple- mentation of procedures to prohibit state fiscal year 2019 expenditure of appropriated funds for abortion facilities. The department also finds an immediate danger to public health, safety, and/or welfare and a compelling governmental interest, which requires this emer- gency action. A proposed rule, which covers the same material, is published in this issue of the Missouri Register. The scope of this emergency rule is limited to the circumstances creating the emergency and complies with the protections extended in the Missouri and United States Constitutions. The department believes this emergency amendment is fair to all interested persons and parties under the cir- cumstances. This emergency rule was filed July 5, 2018, becomes effective July 15, 2018, and expires February 28, 2019. 
(1) Definitions. (A) “Abortion” shall be defined pursuant to section 188.015(1), 
RSMo. (B) “Abortion facility” shall be defined pursuant to section 
188.015(2), RSMo. (C) “Affiliate of an abortion facility.” Factors to be considered in 
making this determination include, but are not limited to: an organi- zation or location that shares, or has in common, any resource with an abortion facility including, but not limited to: operating funds, bank accounts, facilities, employees, service contracts, equipment, mailing lists, trademarks, copyrights, service marks, brands, trade names, financial reporting, marketing, advertising, websites, infor- mation and education materials, or any other assets. 
(D) “Associate of an abortion facility.” Factors to be considered in making this determination include, but are not limited to: an organi- zation or location that shares an organizational structure with an abortion facility including, but not limited to: parent, subsidiary, or sister organizations; or an organization or location with common or interlocking management, ownership, or governance with an abortion facility; or an organization or location with the public appearance of association with an abortion facility, such as a shared name, or part of a name; an alliance or federation with an organization or location that is commonly identified as an advocate for abortion; or that holds itself out, has held itself out, or refers to it itself publicly in a way that demonstrates a connection to an organization or location that is commonly identified as an abortion facility. 
(E) “Counsels women to have an abortion” means encouraging a patient to have an abortion or referring a patient for an abortion when

Emergency Rules 

such abortion does not meet an exception required by federal law. Factors of abortion counseling include, but are not limited to: provid- ing a patient with information encouraging an abortion, or directing a patient to an abortion facility when such abortion would not meet an exception required by federal law. 
(F) “Department” means the Missouri Department of Social Services and all of its divisions, units, and programs. 
(G) “Program” means any project, service, or activity adminis- tered by the department. 
(2) The department shall not expend any funds on any program that performs abortions or provides abortion counseling other than the exceptions required by federal law. 
(3) The department shall not expend any funds to an abortion facility or an affiliate or associate thereof as determined by the department in accordance with this regulation. 
AUTHORITY: sections 11.715 and 11.800 of House Bill 2011, 99th General Assembly, First Regular Session, and sections 208.153, 208.201, and 660.017, RSMo 2016. Emergency rule filed July 5, 2018, effective July 15, 2018, expires Feb. 28, 2019. A proposed rule covering this same material is published in this issue of the Missouri Register. 
Title 19—DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND SENIOR SERVICES Division 10—Office of the Director Chapter 15—Abortions 
EMERGENCY RULE 19 CSR 10-15.060 Prohibition on Expenditure of Funds 
PURPOSE: This rule defines terms used in House Bill 2010, 99th General Assembly, Second Regular Session, for purposes of expendi- tures by the Department of Health and Senior Services. 
PUBLISHER’S NOTE: The secretary of state has determined that the publication of the entire text of the material which is incorporated by reference as a portion of this rule would be unduly cumbersome or expensive. This material as incorporated by reference in this rule shall be maintained by the agency at its headquarters and shall be made available to the public for inspection and copying at no more than the actual cost of reproduction. This note applies only to the ref- erence material. The entire text of the rule is printed here. 
EMERGENCY STATEMENT: House Bill 2010, 99th General Assembly, Second Regular Session (“HB2010”), contains the authority of the Department of Health and Senior Services (department) to spend funds for state fiscal year 2019. State fiscal year 2019 begins and HB2010 took effect July 1, 2018. Section 10.1100 of HB2010 prohibits the department from expending any funds to abortion facilities or “affili- ates or associates thereof.” Section 10.1005 of HB2010 prohibits the department from expending funds on any “program” that performs abortions or “counsels women to have an abortion.” Additionally, section 10.720 of HB2010 prohibits the department from expending certain funds for abortion services which include “referring a patient for an abortion.” HB2010 does not define these terms and phrases and they must be defined in order for the department to timely and effectively implement HB2010. Additionally, the terms and phrases must be defined to give notice to entities that receive funds from the department for providing services. Some entities that received funds in state fiscal year 2018 may not be eligible to receive funds in state fiscal year 2019. The definitions must be in effect as soon as possible after July 1, 2018, to ensure that those parties do not provide services for which they are not eligible to receive payment from the depart- 
ment. The definitions must also be in effect to ensure that the depart- ment does not expend funds in violation of HB2010 and Article IV, Section 28 of the Missouri Constitution. The regular rulemaking process takes several months, and state fiscal year 2019 would be more than half over by the time regular rules would take effect. In the interim, for several months, the department’s ability to expend funds for a variety of health services could be impaired. Impairment of the ability to expend funds for health services could compromise the department’s ability to protect the public health and welfare. Further, if the department does not define the terms and phrases by emergency rule, the department may be subject to legal challenges and attorney fees for having an unpromulgated rule. Moreover, an unpromulgated rule is null, void, and unenforceable. Thus, if the department does not formally promulgate an emergency rule, it may not be able to timely and effectively implement HB2010. Finally, as expressed in the laws of the state of Missouri, the state has a com- pelling governmental interest in protecting the sanctity of human life. Ensuring that no state funds are expended in support of abortion, as expressed in HB2010, furthers that compelling governmental interest. The department finds an immediate danger to the public health, safe- ty, and/or welfare and a compelling governmental interest, which requires this emergency action. A proposed rule, which covers the same material, is published in this issue of the Missouri Register. The scope of this emergency rule is limited to the circumstances cre- ating the emergency and complies with the protections extended in the Missouri and United States Constitutions. The department believes this emergency rule is fair to all interested persons and par- ties under the circumstances. This emergency rule was filed July 5, 2018, becomes effective July 15, 2018, and expires February 28, 2019. 
(1) Definitions. (A) Affiliate of an abortion facility (as used in section 10.1100 of 
HB2010 and this regulation)—factors to be considered in making this determination include, but are not limited to: an organization or loca- tion that shares, or has in common, any resource with an abortion facility including, but not limited to, operating funds, bank accounts, facilities, employees, service contracts, equipment, mailing lists, trademarks, copyrights, service marks, brands, trade names, finan- cial reporting, marketing, advertising, websites, information and education materials, or any other assets. 
(B) Associate of an abortion facility (as used in section 10.1100 of HB2010 and this regulation)—factors to be considered in making this determination include, but are not limited to: an organization or loca- tion that shares an organizational structure with an abortion facility including, but not limited to, parent, subsidiary, or sister organiza- tions; or an organization or location with common or interlocking management, ownership, or governance with an abortion facility; or an organization or location with the public appearance of association with an abortion facility, such as a shared name, or part of a name; an alliance or federation with an organization or location that is com- monly identified as an advocate for abortion; or that holds itself out, has held itself out, or refers to itself publicly in a way that demon- strates a connection to an organization or location that is commonly identified as an abortion facility. 
(C) Counsels women to have an abortion (as used in section 10.1005 of HB2010)—in the absence of an exception required by fed- eral law, includes, but is not limited to, encouraging a patient to have an abortion, referring a patient for an abortion, or providing a patient with information encouraging her to have an abortion. 
(D) Program (as used in section 10.1005 of HB2010)—a project, service, or activity administered by the department. 
(E) Referring a patient for an abortion (as used in section 170.015, RSMo, for purposes of section 10.720 of HB2010)—does not include providing comprehensive, factual information regarding options, so long as the information is provided for all of the options and in a neu- tral manner.

in a neutral manner. Other actions, such as assisting with making an appointment or assisting with transportation, constitute referring a patient for an abortion. 
(2) The department shall not expend any funds to any abortion facil- ity as defined in section 188.015, RSMo, or any affiliate or associate thereof as determined by the department in accordance with this reg- ulation. 
(3) The department shall not expend any funds on any program that, in the absence of an exception required by federal law, performs abor- tions or counsels women to have an abortion. 
(4) Prior to receiving payment from the department for providing ser- vices pursuant to section 10.720 of HB2010, the provider shall com- plete and submit the form included herein declaring that the provider will not submit claims for payment that violate HB2010.

AUTHORITY: sections 192.006, RSMo 2016, and House Bill 2010, 99th General Assembly, Second Regular Session. Emergency rule filed July 5, 2018, effective July 15, 2018, expires Feb. 28, 2019. A proposed rule covering this same material is published in this issue of the Missouri Register. 
Title 20—DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND PROFESSIONAL REGISTRATION 
Division 2150—State Board of Registration for the Healing Arts Chapter 3—Licensing of Physical Therapists and Physical Therapist Assistants 
EMERGENCY AMENDMENT 20 CSR 2150-3.080 Physical Therapists Licensure Fees. The board 
is amending section (1). 
PURPOSE: This rule is being amended to add fees for compact licen- sure, active military, active military spouses, and veterans and fees for the criminal background check as required in section 334.1206, RSMo, and renumber the remaining subsections and paragraphs accordingly. 
EMERGENCY STATEMENT: The Missouri State Board of Registration for the Healing Arts (board) is statutorily obligated to set all fees by regulation necessary to administer the provisions of Chapter 334, RSMo. Pursuant to section 334.601, RSMo, the board shall set the amount of fees for applicants who seek to practice physical therapy in the state of Missouri, including persons seeking licensure through Physical Therapy Licensure Compact. Further, section 334.1206, RSMo mandates the board to “fully implement a criminal background check requirement.” Pursuant to section 536.025, RSMo, this emer- gency amendment is necessary to preserve a compelling governmental interest—compliance with sections 334.601 and 334.1206, RSMo – which requires an early effective date. Because without the amendment establishing the compact privilege fees and the criminal history back- ground fees (fingerprinting fees), compact privilege requests would not be able to be processed on July 9, 2018, nor would the board be able to implement the Physical Therapy Licensure Compact in the state of Missouri, in potential violation of sections 334.1224 and 334.1227, RSMo. Furthermore, this emergency amendment limits its scope to the circumstances creating the emergency and complies with the protec- tions extended by the Missouri and United States Constitutions. By establishing the proper fee schedule and implementing the compact, physical therapists who reside in other compact states will be able to practice in the state of Missouri upon the issuance of the compact privilege. This clears the path to practicing physical therapy services in the state of Missouri, and offers a state-based solution to the chal- lenges faced by physical therapist who need interstate licensure portability; and more importantly, it will improve Missourians’ access to physical therapy services by giving eligible applicants a faster and less expensive alternative to seeking traditional licensure. Adoption of the amendment also helps provide long-awaited licensure mobility for military spouses and veterans. Missouri citizens will ben- efit from improved continuity of care, improved access, and have more choices for physical therapy services delivered in diversified methods. This emergency amendment is limited to physical therapy applicants who are licensed in other compact states and preserves the tradition path to licensure for all other applicants. The normal rule- making process would require these applicants to wait six (6) months for the rule change to go through the process, delaying their ability to obtain employment and provide much needed physical therapy treatment to Missouri patients. The board also believes this emer- gency amendment to be fair to all interested persons and parties under the circumstances. This emergency amendment was filed July 3, 2018, becomes effective July 13, 2018, and expires February 28, 2019.

Further, section 334.1206, RSMo mandates the board to “fully implement a criminal back- ground check requirement” for persons applying for the compact privilege. Pursuant to section 536.025, RSMo, this emergency amendment is necessary to preserve a compelling governmental interest—compliance with sections 334.601 and 334.1206, RSMo – which requires an early effective date. Because without the amend- ment establishing the compact privilege fees and the criminal history background fees (fingerprinting fees), compact privilege requests would not be able to be processed on July 9, 2018, nor would the board be able to implement the Physical Therapy Licensure Compact in the state of Missouri, in potential violation of sections 334.1224 and 334.1227, RSMo. Furthermore, this emergency amendment limits

its scope to the circumstances creating the emergency and complies with the protections extended by the Missouri and United States Constitutions. By establishing the proper fee schedule and imple- menting the compact, physical therapist assistants who reside in other compact states will be able to practice in the state of Missouri upon the issuance of the compact privilege. This clears the path to practicing physical therapy services in the state of Missouri, and offers a state-based solution to the challenges faced by physical ther- apist assistants who need interstate licensure portability; and more importantly, it will improve Missourians’ access to physical therapy services by giving eligible applicants a faster and less expensive alternative to seeking traditional licensure. Adoption of the amend- ment also helps provide long-awaited licensure mobility for military spouses and veterans. Missouri citizens will benefit from improved continuity of care, improved access, and have more choices for phys- ical therapy services delivered in diversified methods. This emer- gency amendment is limited to physical therapist assistant applicants who are licensed in other compact states and preserves the tradition- al path to licensure for all other applicants. The normal rulemaking process would require these applicants to wait six (6) months for the rule change to go through the process, delaying their ability to obtain employment and provide much needed physical therapy treatment to Missouri patients. The board also believes this emergency amend- ment to be fair to all interested persons and parties under the circum- stances. This emergency amendment was filed July 3, 2018, becomes effective July 13, 2018, and expires February 28, 2019.

20 CSR 2150-3.300 Physical Therapy Compact Rules 
PURPOSE: This rule incorporates by reference the Physical Therapy Compact Rules and provides the Missouri Board of Registration for the Healing Arts authority to implement and enforce the Physical Therapy Compact Rules. This rule also effectuates and aids in the interpretation of the Physical Therapy Licensure Compact, sections 334.1200-334.1233, RSMo. 
PUBLISHER’S NOTE: The secretary of state has determined that the publication of the entire text of the material which is incorporated by reference as a portion of this rule would be unduly cumbersome or expensive. This material as incorporated by reference in this rule shall be maintained by the agency at its headquarters and shall be made available to the public for inspection and copying at no more than the actual cost of reproduction. This note applies only to the ref- erence material. The entire text of the rule is printed here. 
EMERGENCY STATEMENT: The Missouri State Board of Registration for the Healing Arts (board) is statutorily obligated to promulgate reg- ulations necessary to administer the provisions of Chapter 334, RSMo. Pursuant to 334.1224, RSMo, rules and amendments promulgated by the Physical Therapy Compact Commission “shall become binding as of the date specified in each rule or amendment.” The Physical Therapy Compact Commission adopted Physical Therapy Compact Rules on July 9, 2018 and it became binding on the state of Missouri as of that date. Section 334.1227, RSMo, also requires the board take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate the Physical Therapy Compact’s purposes and intent. Pursuant to section 536.025, RSMo, this emergency promulgation is necessary to preserve a com- pelling governmental interest –compliance with sections 334.1224 and 334.1227, RSMo –which requires an early effective date. Because without the Physical Therapy Compact Rules being incorpo- rated into the board’s regulation, the board would lack authority to implement and enforce the Physical Therapy Compact Rules and potentially violate sections 334.1224 and 334.1227, RSMo. Furthermore, this emergency rule limits its scope to the circumstances creating the emergency and complies with the protections extended by the Missouri and United States Constitutions. 
By adopting a rule to incorporate the Physical Therapy Licensure Compact Rules in the state of Missouri, physical therapists and phys- ical therapy assistants who reside in other compact states will have a path to practicing physical therapy services in the state of Missouri that reduces the challenges faced by interstate licensure portability. Adoption of this rule will also provide long-awaited licensure mobil- ity for active military, active military spouses, and veterans. 
Missouri citizens will benefit from improved continuity of care, improved access, and have more choices for physical therapy services delivered in diversified methods. This emergency rule is limited to physical therapy and physical therapy assistant applicants who are licensed in another compact state and preserves the traditional path to licensure for all other applicants. The normal rulemaking process would require these applicants to wait six (6) months for the rule change to go through the process, delaying their ability to obtain employment and provide much needed physical therapy treatment to Missouri patients. The board also believes this emergency amend- ment to be fair to all interested persons and parties under the circum- stances. This emergency rule was filed July 3, 2018, becomes effec- tive July 13, 2018, and expires February 28, 2019.

MISSOURI Proposed Rules August 15, 2018 REGISTER Vol. 43, No. 16 

Under this heading will appear the text of proposed rules and changes. The notice of proposed rulemaking is required to contain an explanation of any new rule or any change in an existing rule and the reasons therefor. This is set out in the Purpose section with each rule. Also required is a citation to the legal authority to make rules. This appears fol- lowing the text of the rule, after the word “Authority.” Entirely new rules are printed without any special symbol- 
ogy under the heading of proposed rule. If an existing rule is to be amended or rescinded, it will have a heading of proposed amendment or proposed rescission. Rules which are proposed to be amended will have new matter printed in boldface type and matter to be deleted placed in brackets. An important function of the Missouri Register is to solicit 
and encourage public participation in the rulemaking process. The law provides that for every proposed rule, amendment, or rescission there must be a notice that anyone may comment on the proposed action. This comment may take different forms. If an agency is required by statute to hold a public hearing 
before making any new rules, then a Notice of Public Hearing will appear following the text of the rule. Hearing dates must be at least thirty (30) days after publication of the notice in the Missouri Register. If no hearing is planned or required, the agency must give a Notice to Submit Comments. This allows anyone to file statements in support of or in opposition to the proposed action with the agency within a specified time, no less than thirty (30) days after pub- lication of the notice in the Missouri Register. 
An agency may hold a public hearing on a rule even though not required by law to hold one. If an agency allows comments to be received following the hearing date, the close of comments date will be used as the beginning day in the ninety- (90-) day-count necessary for the filing of the order of rulemaking. 
If an agency decides to hold a public hearing after planning not to, it must withdraw the earlier notice and file a new notice of proposed rulemaking and schedule a hearing for a date not less than thirty (30) days from the date of publication of the new notice.

PROPOSED RESCISSION 
11 CSR 70-2.220 Prohibiting Manufacturers and Solicitors of Intoxicating Liquor and Licensed Retailers From Contacting Each Other for Business Purposes. This rule prohibited contact between manufacturers or solicitors and retail licensees who were licensed to sell intoxicating liquor in excess of five percent by weight. 
PURPOSE: This rule is being rescinded because it is no longer in line with the reality of business in the liquor industry, and the many statutory exceptions that allow contact between the upper and lower tier of the liquor industry. The existing section would prohibit current practices such as private labels. 
AUTHORITY: section 311.660, RSMo Supp. 1989. This version of 
rule filed Feb. 8, 1973, effective Feb. 18, 1973. Rescinded: Filed July 9, 2018. 
PUBLIC COST: This proposed rescission will not cost state agencies or political subdivisions more than five hundred dollars ($500) in the aggregate.

NOTICE TO SUBMIT COMMENTS: Anyone may file a statement in support of or in opposition to this proposed rescission with the Division of Alcohol and Tobacco Control at 1738 East Elm Street, Lower Level in Jefferson City, Mo 65101 or by facsimile at (573) 526- 4540, or via email at Karen.Dorton@dps.mo.gov.

PURPOSE: This rule establishes guidelines for the use of minors in tobacco investigations by a state, county, municipal or other local law enforcement authority. It is duplicative of section 407.934.5, RSMo, and therefore should be rescinded. 
AUTHORITY: section 407.934.5, RSMo Supp. 2001. Original rule filed Sept. 27, 2001, effective March 30, 2002. Rescinded: Filed July 9, 2018.

By the authority vested in the Missouri Board of Pharmacy under sections 338.140 and 338.220, RSMo 2016, and section 338.010, RSMo Supp. 2017, the board amends a rule as follows: 
20 CSR 2220-6.050 Administration of Vaccines Per Protocol is amended. 
A notice of proposed rulemaking containing the text of the proposed amendment was published in the Missouri Register on March 15, 2018 (43 MoReg 583–586). No changes have been made in the text of the proposed amendment, so it is not reprinted here. This pro- posed amendment becomes effective thirty (30) days after publication in the Code of State Regulations. 
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS: The board received three (3) com- ments on the proposed amendment from the National Association of Chain Drug Stores (NACDS). 
COMMENT #1: NACDS suggested amending paragraph (4)(A)10. to remove the requirement that non-pharmacy immunization sites must be listed in the governing protocol. RESPONSE: The board is willing to consider allowing immunization at other medical care facilities without specific protocol designation (e.g., long-term care facilities). However, section 338.010, RSMo, requires consultation with the Missouri Board of Registration for the Healing Arts (BOHA) to incorporate the suggested change. Accordingly, no changes have been made in response to the sugges- tion at this time, however, the board will consult with BOHA for future amendment. 
COMMENT #2: NACDS asked to amend subsection (4)(C) to remove the requirement that the protocol physician re-sign a protocol when a new pharmacist is added. NACDS alternatively suggested that the rule allow immunization protocols between the physician and pharmacy. 
RESPONSE: Section 338.010, RSMo, requires a protocol between a physician and the specific pharmacist. As a result, no changes have been made in response to the suggestion. 
COMMENT #3: NACDS suggested amending subsection (6)(E) to allow reporting to the state vaccination registry in lieu of the pro- posed notification requirements. RESPONSE: The board agrees reporting to the state immunization registry would be beneficial for both prescribers and patients. Legislation is currently pending to require ShowMeVax reporting as suggested. Accordingly, no changes have been made in response to the comment at this time. However, the suggestion may be reconsid- ered if legislation is not enacted.
